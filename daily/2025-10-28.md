As benchmark. And have Tony Drummond as advisor!? And echo launchpad.

If we do fairlaunch now, we can raise with many launchpads easily. How specifically? And also then have high ATH for FUNDE. And then can raise more funds OTC (need to reserve!). And also then can raise for another project easily.

Analyze LinkedIn post and see how we could improve or are we covering already all points?

**Project Structure Reference:**
- 📁 **MindFool project** shows ideal structure:
  - `/mindfool/` parent folder
  - `/mindfool/mindfool.games/` - mobile app
  - `/mindfool/mindfool.games-web/` - web (Next.js + Vercel)
  - `/mindfool/mindfool.games-spec-docs/` - specs
  - Each has own git repo, Vercel deployment, domain setup
  - TODO: Apply this structure to other projects (AkunIndo, FunDeFi, Printora)
  - **Important**: Don't mess up existing setups, plan migration carefully
