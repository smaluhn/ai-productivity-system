## 🌙 End of Day Review

### What Went Well ✅
- **Massive organization session**: Root folder (23→5), Inbox (27→0), 100% categorized
- **Comprehensive planning**: Week plan created with all team goals, critical paths, success metrics
- **Tomorrow fully prepped**: 3 meetings with detailed agendas, prep questions, and success criteria
- **System clarity**: Answered index.md vs TODAY.md question with clear daily workflow guide
- **Learning system**: Created inbox processing with 10 rules that improve over time
- **All integrations configured**: MCP auto-approvals for Calendar, Fireflies, Reclaim
- **GitHub Projects setup**: All 27 issues properly organized (19 in #7 Dev, 8 in #5 Ops)
- **Documentation excellence**: 6 new comprehensive guides created

### What Could Be Better 🔄
- Started late (4:25 PM instead of morning) - cost some productive hours
- Project #7 web UI not displaying issues (CLI confirms they exist - likely cache issue)
- Need to verify fix on Monday after clearing cache
- FunDe.Fi pitch deck work didn't happen (pushed to next week, acceptable)

### Key Learnings 💡
- **Empty files = quick actions**, not reference material (inbox processing rule)
- **Project name in filename** → automatic categorization opportunity
- **Two-file daily system optimal**: index.md (morning check) + TODAY.md (all-day workspace)
- **Systematic beats ad-hoc**: 27 items processed in 30 min with 100% accuracy using rules
- **Auto-approvals are workflow multipliers** - should have done this earlier
- **Learning systems compound**: Inbox processing rules will save time every session

### Tomorrow's Top 3 🎯
1. [ ] **Brendan Lucas Meeting (10 AM)** - Assess Starboard Finance partnership for FunDe.Fi/FavOS
2. [ ] **Yose Rizal Meeting (11:30 AM)** - Explore MWX AI collaboration opportunities for Printora
3. [ ] **Team Meeting (2-5 PM)** - CRITICAL: Get Nhung/Thuy GitHub usernames, align entire team on MVP execution, surface all blockers

### Week Ahead Preview 📅
- **Monday**: Onboard Nhung/Thuy to GitHub, upload docs, start critical path items
- **MVP Deadline**: November 1 (Friday) - 5 days!
- **Critical Path**: Stripe Sandbox (#3) → Checkout (#9), AI Studio (#10) → Deploy (#2)
- **Success**: All 5 critical features in progress by Monday EOD
