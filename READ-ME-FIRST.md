## 💡 Key Insight

**Issues vs Projects** (most important thing to understand):

- **Issues** = Tasks that live in repositories
- **Projects** = Dashboards that DISPLAY issues

Issues DON'T move. Projects LINK to them.

Think:
- Repository = Filing cabinet (where documents live)
- Project = Dashboard (shows filtered view)

**Your setup**:
- Dev issues → live in `printora` repo → show in "Printora Development" project
- Marketing issues → live in `printora-marketing` repo → show in "Printora Operations" project
