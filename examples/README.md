# Examples

Real-world examples of the AI Productivity System in action.

## Printora Example

**Project**: Printora.ai - AI-powered print-on-demand platform
**Team Size**: 5 people (3 developers, 1 operations, 1 executive)
**Meeting**: Bali Team Meeting - Oct 25, 2025

### Files
- `printora/2025-10-25-11am-bali-team-meeting-fireflies.md` - Full meeting notes
- `printora/printora-action-items-2025-10-25.md` - Extracted action items

### What This Example Shows

1. **Meeting Processing**
   - How to structure Fireflies meeting notes
   - Extracting discussion points with timestamps
   - Identifying key decisions made

2. **Action Item Extraction**
   - Converting discussions into specific tasks
   - Assigning team members based on their roles
   - Setting priorities and deadlines
   - Organizing by repository (dev vs marketing vs docs)

3. **Team Organization**
   - 3 developers with different specializations (frontend, backend, AI/ML)
   - 1 operations person (marketing, admin, research)
   - 1 executive (high-level guidance, review)

4. **Multi-Repo Strategy**
   - `printora` - Main application development
   - `printora-marketing` - Marketing automation and content
   - `printora-spec-docs` - Documentation and specifications

5. **Milestone Planning**
   - MVP Launch (critical, end of next week)
   - Phase 2 (post-MVP features)
   - Backlog (long-term vision)

### Key Takeaways

- **20 action items** extracted from a 72-minute meeting
- Tasks assigned to **5 team members** based on expertise
- **3 priority levels**: Critical (MVP), High (this week), Medium (next 2 weeks)
- **4 different work areas**: Frontend, Backend, AI/ML, Marketing, Admin
- **Clear deadlines**: End of next week for MVP, rolling for others

### How to Use This Example

1. Review the meeting notes structure
2. See how action items were extracted
3. Notice the organization by repository and priority
4. Use as a template for your own projects

### Results

This systematic approach resulted in:
- Clear task assignments for entire team
- No ambiguity about who does what
- Explicit deadlines for MVP launch
- Organized backlog for future phases
- Single source of truth in GitHub

## Other Examples (Coming Soon)

- **Remote Team** - Distributed team coordination
- **Client Projects** - Agency workflow
