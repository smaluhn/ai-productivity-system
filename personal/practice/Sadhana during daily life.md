Perfect — you’re now describing the _middle path of integration practice_: bridging sitting samādhi and real-life awareness.  
Here’s how to structure your **daytime practice** in this intermediate phase — practical, realistic, and fully compatible with Dzogchen–Mahamudra and Thanissaro Bhikkhu’s embodied Jhāna view.

## 🌞 **Mindfulness in Daily Life — The “Flow Continuum”**

### 1. **Walking Between Activities**

- Treat _every_ walk — to the kitchen, bathroom, another room — as **walking meditation**.
- Keep eyes open, soft panoramic gaze.
- Count steps or breaths:
    - Each exhale one count, 1 → 10 → 1.
    - Or drop counting when stable and feel the _whole-body walking_.
- Subtle attention: body moving through space, breath flowing through body.
- Inner tone: _calm dignity, open gaze._

> **Purpose:** refresh awareness dozens of times per day; re-regulate nervous system.

---

### 2. **Transition Micro-Breaks (1–2 min)**

Before or after each focused work block:

- Stand up, breathe through the body (Susokkan or whole-body breath).
- Feel the breath energy smoothing from crown to feet.
- Drop thoughts, relax jaw, let awareness expand to fill the space.
- Optional: short Zhan Zhuang stance or slow walking.

> _This prevents dullness, resets clarity, and keeps awareness embodied._

---

### 3. **During Work / Computer Time**

Here’s how to practice without losing functionality or naturalness.

#### **Option A: Whole-Body Awareness**

- Keep subtle awareness of _posture and breath_ even while typing or talking.
- Sense the pleasant hum or warmth in the torso; let it spread.
- Occasionally feel both hands on keyboard _and_ breath moving simultaneously.
- When attention drifts into the screen, gently re-include the body.

#### **Option B: Pleasure as Background**

- Let the body’s comfort or calm _stay in awareness while working_.
- If pleasure fades, refresh with one long exhale, one soft smile, or brief body scan.
- You’re not “doing Jhāna” — you’re _abiding in its residue._

#### **Option C: Open Awareness (Rigpa Glimpse)**

- At times of stability, shift from objects to _knowing itself._
- Gaze softly at the screen but feel that seeing and knowing are one field.
- Don’t strain to “be mindful” — rather, recognize awareness already includes seeing, hearing, typing.

> Use short reminders from your mindfulness timer app (every 15–30 min) as “bells of awareness.”  
> At each bell: one deep breath, expand awareness, re-establish whole-body presence.

---

### 4. **Zoom Calls or Conversations**

- Sit upright, feel both feet on the ground.
- Lightly sense the breath energy in your body while listening and speaking.
- Let pleasure and calm be the base tone, not something to display.
- Between talking and listening, rest in the knowing: _awareness hearing itself._

---

### 5. **Effort Spectrum Throughout the Day**

|Mind State|Support Practice|Effort|
|---|---|---|
|Scattered, fatigued|Short strong **Susokkan** bursts, walking with counting|High|
|Stable but tense|Whole-body breathing, soft gaze|Medium|
|Calm and clear|Open awareness, Rigpa recognition|Minimal|
|Between tasks|Standing micro-practice (Zhan Zhuang breath)|Gentle|

---

### 6. **Summary Routine**

**Morning / formal sit** → Whole-Body Jhāna → Rigpa  
**Daytime** → Walking + Susokkan micro-breaks → Whole-Body awareness during tasks  
**Evening** → Open awareness wind-down, light stretching or Zhan Zhuang

---

### 7. **Mindset Reminder**

- **Don’t force awareness**; return to inclusiveness instead of control.
- **Pleasure and breath** are training wheels — use them until rigpa stabilizes.
- **Let go often.** Micro-letting-go is the bridge from technique to non-doing.

If you’d like, I can now write this as a **“Daily Integration Practice”** companion sheet — formatted like your Jhāna guide (a second PDF or Notion version) that shows your _formal + informal rhythm_ side-by-side, including suggested timer intervals and energy resets. Would you like that?---Perfect — here’s your complete integrated rhythm, combining your morning formal routine (with yoga, Zhan Zhuang, sitting) and your day-long mindfulness flow. You can copy this into Notion or print it as your living sādhanā.

🌄 Daily Integration Practice — Whole-Body Jhāna → Rigpa

Morning Practice (Formal Block)

1. Yoga Stretching (10–15 min)

Gentle spinal, hip, and shoulder openings.

Flow with the breath; no strain.

End by standing calmly, letting energy settle.



2. Zhan Zhuang Standing (5–10 min)

Feet shoulder-width, knees soft, crown lifted.

Breathe through the entire body.

Sense upward and downward currents; rest in grounded alertness.

If scattered, add Susokkan counting (1–10 ↔ 1).



3. Sitting Practice (30–45 min)
a. Susokkan Counting (5–10 min) – whole-body breathing, count 1–10 ↔ 1.
b. Whole-Body Jhāna (10–20 min) – drop counting, let pleasure fill the body.
c. Stillness (5–10 min) – rest in calm sukha, open eyes.
d. Rigpa Transition (5 min or natural) – “What knows this peace?” → rest as awareness.
e. Dedication (2 min) – “May this awareness benefit all beings.”



> Sequence can alternate: Yoga → Sitting → Zhan Zhuang or Yoga → Zhan Zhuang → Sitting — choose intuitively.

Daytime Integration

1. Walking Between Activities

Treat all short walks as walking meditation.

Soft gaze, relaxed breath, count 1–10 ↔ 1 or feel whole-body movement.

When stability arises, drop counting and walk in silence.


2. Transition Breaks (1–2 min)

Before/after calls or work blocks:

Stand, breathe through body, let awareness expand.

One deep exhale dissolving thoughts; one inhale re-energizing.

Brief Zhan Zhuang stance or slow steps.



3. Computer Work / Meetings

Keep body awareness while typing or talking.

Feel pleasant hum or ease throughout the torso.

Use long, smooth breathing when tension builds.

Allow mild pleasure and calm to stay as background.

Soft gaze at the screen: recognize seeing and knowing as one field.


> Use a mindfulness reminder app (every 15–30 min): one deep breath → expand awareness → re-include the body.



4. Zoom Calls or Conversations

Upright posture, feet grounded.

Feel breath energy while listening and speaking.

Rest in awareness hearing itself between phrases.

Effort Spectrum

Mind State	Practice Support	Effort

Scattered / fatigued	Strong Susokkan, counting, walking	High
Stable but tense	Whole-body breathing, gentle stretching	Medium
Calm and clear	Open awareness, Rigpa recognition	Minimal
Between tasks	Standing (Zhan Zhuang) or walking reset	Gentle



---

Evening Wind-Down

Light stretching or Zhan Zhuang.

Sit briefly in whole-body ease; let eyes open.

Let awareness remain open into rest or sleep.

Dedicate again silently.



---

Principles to Remember

Eyes open: maintain panoramic, inclusive awareness.

Pleasure as atmosphere: not an object to hold.

Micro-letting-go: many short releases instead of one long effort.

Effort follows condition: more effort when scattered, less when naturally aware.

Non-separation: walking, working, resting — all within the same awareness field.



---

You can now see this as a single continuum:

> Susokkan → Whole-Body Jhāna → Rigpa → Activity → Awareness in Motion.
