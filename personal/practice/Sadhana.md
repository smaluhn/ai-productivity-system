That’s an elegant, well-rounded rhythm — very much in the spirit of the _Thai Forest_ and _Dzogchen–Mahamudra_ integration you’re aiming for. Below is a draft you can treat as a **daily sādhana sheet**, adaptable to morning or any sitting period, and usable in Notion or print. It ties together **Susokkan**, **walking practice**, **Zhan Zhuang**, **whole-body Jhāna**, and the **transition to rigpa**.

## 🕉️ Daily Whole-Body Samādhi → Rigpa Sequence

### 1. **Preparation (1–3 min)**

- Stand or sit upright; eyes half-open.
- Briefly recollect motivation: “May this practice bring clarity and benefit.”
- Feel feet, spine, crown aligned; relax the chest and face.

---

### 2. **Standing / Zhan Zhuang Phase (3–5 min)**

- Stand as if lightly suspended from the crown.
- Hands relaxed or held in front of lower abdomen.
- Breathe naturally through the whole body.
- Sense gentle currents of energy rising and sinking.
- If the mind is scattered, begin **Susokkan counting** here (1–10, 10–1).

> _Purpose:_ awaken the body’s energy channels, link posture-energy-awareness.

---

### 3. **Walking Meditation with Counting (5–15 min)**

- Walk at natural pace, eyes open, gaze soft.
- Sync steps and breath:
    - Inhale = 1 step, Exhale = 1 step (adjust rhythm).
    - Count cycles 1 → 10 → 1 repeatedly.
- When attention stabilizes, drop counting and simply feel **whole-body walking** — weight shift, air touch, light awareness behind the eyes.
- Occasionally ask: _“Who is walking?”_ and rest briefly in the knowing.

> _Purpose:_ anchor mindfulness in movement; carry awareness into daily walking.

---

### 4. **Sitting Sequence (20–40 min total)**

#### **a. Susokkan – Counting Stage (5–10 min)**

- Sit comfortably, eyes open or gently lowered.
- Follow breath through the whole body, counting 1–10 → 1.
- Each count = one full breath.
- Let breath energy feel _global_—not only at the nose or belly.

> _Signs:_ thoughts quiet; body feels coherent; attention steady.

#### **b. Whole-Body Awareness & Pleasure (10–20 min)**

- Drop counting; maintain inclusive knowing.
- Allow pleasant warmth or subtle vibration to **fill the body**.
- Breathe ease into neglected areas until uniform comfort spreads.
- If energy is too intense, lengthen exhalation; if dull, brighten inhalation.

> _This is the first Jhāna in the sutta/Thai-forest sense—body and mind unified, suffused with ease._

#### **c. Stillness / Second Jhāna Flavor (5–10 min)**

- As pīti subsides, stay with quiet _sukha_.
- Nothing to control. Awareness and body are one field of calm brightness.

#### **d. Transition to Rigpa (5 min or as long as natural)**

- Let the question arise silently: **“What knows this peace?”**
- Drop the question; rest in that knowing itself.
- Eyes open, unfocused; senses undivided.
- Recognize that awareness and appearances are inseparable.
- If attention collapses, briefly return to the breath or body energy, then release again.

> _Now the practice shifts from doing to being—Mahamudra/Dzogchen mode._

---

### 5. **Dedication & Integration (2–3 min)**

- Dedicate the ease and clarity:
    
    > “May this awareness benefit all beings.”
    
- Before rising, feel the same openness while moving fingers, adjusting posture.
- Stand up slowly; keep awareness wide as you transition to ordinary activity.

## 🌿 Practice Principles

|Situation|Method|Effort Level|
|---|---|---|
|Mind scattered, sleepy, active day|Strong Susokkan, clear counting|High effort|
|Mind stable, relaxed|Whole-body breathing, pleasure Jhāna|Moderate|
|Mind open, naturally aware|Rest as awareness itself|Minimal / none|
|Physical movement|Walking + Counting or Zhan Zhuang|Gentle continuous mindfulness|

## 🪶 Notes on Subtle Points

- **Eyes open:** prevents slipping into tunnel-vision absorption; supports Dzogchen compatibility.
- **Pleasure vs. whole-body:** treat pleasure as atmosphere, not object; remain inclusive.
- **Transitions:** every return to counting or movement is an _upaya_ (skillful means), not regression.
- **Rigpa recognition:** when awareness recognizes its own clarity without effort, drop all technique; let the Jhāna’s serenity become background radiance.
