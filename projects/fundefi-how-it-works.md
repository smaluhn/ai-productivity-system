# FunDeFi - How It Works

> Community-driven launchpad with fair launch mechanics and futarchy-inspired governance

---

## 🚀 Get Funded
**How projects get initial funding**

### Founders post ideas with minimum USDC targets
Clearly stating what they aim to build and how much funding they need to get started.

### Anyone can contribute USDC to back projects they believe in
Community members evaluate ideas and contribute funding to the ones they find most promising.

### If a project reaches its target, it goes live. Otherwise, everyone gets their USDC back
This ensures only ideas with sufficient community support move forward, and there's no risk of lost funds if a target isn't met.

---

## 🎊 Go Live
**Successfully establish a project**

### Tokens are distributed proportionally to everyone who contributed USDC
Backers receive ownership stakes based on their initial contributions, aligning incentives from day one.

### 25% of the USDC and tokens are paired in a liquidity pool
Establishing market-based price discovery and enabling token transferability from the start.

**Token Distribution:**
- **25% liquid tokens** - Immediately tradeable at TGE
- **75% veFUNDE NFTs** - Locked for governance and staking
  - 3 NFT tranches: 3 months, 6 months, 9 months (25% each)
  - Can be used for voting while locked
  - Optional: Auto-stake for bonus rewards

### The liquidity position, remaining USDC, and ability to mint new tokens are transferred to a newly-created DAO
Establishing on-chain governance from day one. The community controls:
- Treasury funds
- Token minting rights
- Project direction
- Future fundraising

## 🏗️ Build
**How projects grow and evolve**

### Contributors raise proposals to spend USDC and receive token allocations
Enabling transparent and community-driven resource allocation for development efforts.

### Governance decisions are made by decision markets (futarchy-inspired)
You trade on how the DAO should be run and grow your portfolio when the market agrees with you.

**How Decision Markets Work:**
1. **Dual Markets Created** - Each proposal gets "pass" and "fail" markets
2. **Trade with FUNDE + USDC** - Stake on outcomes you believe in
3. **Price Determines Outcome** - Proposal passes if FUNDE price higher in "pass" market
4. **Market-Driven Wisdom** - Collective intelligence guides decisions

**Example:**
- Proposal: "Spend 50K USDC on marketing campaign"
- Pass market: FUNDE trades at $1.20
- Fail market: FUNDE trades at $1.10
- **Result**: Proposal passes (market believes it increases value)

### Anti-Rug Protection
If the founder rugs, anyone can raise a proposal to liquidate the treasury and return USDC to tokenholders - providing a safety mechanism that protects contributors and incentivizes founder accountability.
