# Bali.Fashion - AI Video Content for Fashion Stores
## Project Overview

---

## 🎯 **Business Concept**

Help Bali fashion and clothing stores create professional video content using AI, set up e-commerce shops, and maintain engaging social media presence.

**Target:** Fashion boutiques, clothing stores, jewelry shops in Bali that:
- Only have Instagram/Facebook (no proper e-commerce)
- Post static photos but need video content
- Want to compete with modern brands but lack content resources

---

## 💡 **The Problem**

### **What Fashion Stores Face:**
1. **Video is king** - TikTok/Reels dominate, but hiring videographers is expensive
2. **No e-commerce** - They lose sales to customers who want to buy online
3. **Content burnout** - Running a store + creating daily content is exhausting
4. **Competition** - Big brands have video teams, they don't

### **Current Alternatives:**
- Hire videographer: 2-5M IDR per shoot
- Buy expensive camera equipment: 10-30M IDR
- Spend hours learning editing: Time they don't have
- Post only static photos: Get buried in algorithm
