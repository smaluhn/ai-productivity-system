## 💡 **Key Insights / Notes**

### **Why This Can Work:**
1. **Problem is real:** 70% of Bali fashion stores have weak video content
2. **Solution is unique:** AI-powered video generation is cutting edge
3. **Pricing is accessible:** 2.5M/month is affordable vs. hiring videographer
4. **Market is underserved:** No competitors doing exactly this
5. **Timing is perfect:** Reels/TikTok dominating, stores need video

### **Risks to Manage:**
1. AI video quality - Must test thoroughly before selling
2. Store owner skepticism - Overcome with free samples
3. Competition could emerge - Move fast, build relationships
4. Scalability - Need to automate video generation process
5. Client retention - Deliver consistent quality monthly

### **Competitive Advantages:**
- First mover in Bali AI video for fashion
- Tech + creative hybrid service
- Monthly subscription = recurring revenue
- Can scale without hiring videographers
- Bali-specific local knowledge
