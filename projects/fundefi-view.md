## 🎯 key opportunities

### bio referral program
- refer researchers launching on bio protocol
- earn 20k bio tokens ($2k+ usd) per researcher
- target: researchers seeking $50-500k funding

### benchmark launchpads
- **metadao** - futarchy governance model, post-TGE OTC strategy
- **echo launchpad** - competitive analysis
- potential: tony drummond as advisor

### two-phase fundraising strategy

**phase 1: fair launch (pre-tge)**
- 7 launchpads: target $500-700k
- no vc pre-sales, no discounts
- community-first approach
- selena finance vesting model (25% tokens + 75% ve nfts)

**phase 2: post-tge otc deals (1-3 months after launch)**
- **reserve 10-15% of total supply** for strategic vc raises
- **target: $2-3m from top-tier vcs** (paradigm, variant, framework, dragonfly)
- **pricing: spot market or 10-20% premium only** (no discounts!)
- **minimal/no vesting** (vcs buy at market = no dump risk)
- **twap execution** (24-48 hour gradual purchase)
- **dao governance approval** required for each deal
- **benefits:**
  - additional capital without pre-tge dilution
  - vc validation post-launch (marketing value)
  - no dump risk (bought at premium)
  - community controls pricing

**total potential raise: $2.5-3.7m** ($700k fair launch + $2-3m otc)

### metadao learnings (applied to fundefi)
1. **no vc discounts** - community rejected 30% discount deal, vcs paid spot/premium
2. **transparent otc process** - all deals public, dao-approved
3. **futarchy governance** - market-driven decisions (could integrate later)
4. **pay-for-performance** - insider unlocks tied to price performance
5. **unruggable structure** - ip, treasury, minting controlled by dao
6. **high-float ico** - launch early, grow over time (not high fdv low float)
