**Tagline:**
*Where Markets Meet Governance - Empowering the Next Generation of Web3 Projects*

## 🚀 Section 1: Get Funded

### **How projects raise initial capital**

#### **Founders submit comprehensive project proposals**
Projects post their vision with clear milestones, funding targets, and deliverables. veFUNDE holders review and vote on which projects deserve community backing.

**What Projects Need:**
- Detailed roadmap with verifiable milestones
- Funding target ($50K-$500K recommended)
- Team background and track record
- Product demo or prototype (if available)
- Clear value proposition

#### **veFUNDE holders vote to approve projects**
Community members stake FUNDE tokens to gain voting power. Only projects with strong community support (20% quorum + 51% approval) move forward to fundraising.

**Voting Power:**
- Lock FUNDE → Get veFUNDE (vote-escrowed)
- Longer locks = More voting power (3mo-4yr)
- More participation = Better GMA (Guaranteed Minimum Allocation)
- Voters earn yields from ALL successful projects

#### **Approved projects launch fundraising rounds**
Once approved, projects enter a 6-day fundraising window. Community members contribute USDC to back projects they believe in.

**Fundraising Structure:**
- **6-day sale window** (single round, fair price)
- **veFUNDE holders only** (must hold any amount)
- **GMA-based allocations** (bigger stakes = bigger allocations)
- **If target reached** → Project goes live ✅
- **If shortfall** → Reserve fund fills gap (prevents failed launches)

**Why This Works:**
✅ Quality filter (community voting prevents scams)
✅ Guaranteed funding (reserve fund ensures success)
✅ Fair allocation (GMA rewards commitment, not wealth)
✅ No risk of failed launches (protocol buys unsold allocations)

---

## 🎊 Section 2: Go Live

### **Successfully launch your project**

#### **Tokens distributed to all backers**
Everyone who contributed USDC receives TOKEN based on their contribution size. Allocations are proportional and transparent.

**Distribution Mechanics:**
- **Proportional ownership** (1% of raise = 1% of allocation)
- **Instant access** to 25% liquid tokens at TGE
- **Locked voting power** from 75% veFUNDE NFTs
- **Auto-staking bonus** (optional: stake liquid 25% for +5-20% extra)

#### **Token Distribution Structure:**

**25% Liquid Tokens** - Immediately tradeable at TGE
- Can sell, trade, or provide liquidity
- **OR** auto-stake for bonus rewards (see below)

**75% veFUNDE NFTs** - Locked for governance and staking
- **3 NFT tranches:** 3 months, 6 months, 9 months (25% each)
- Can be used for voting while locked
- Earn trading fees while vested
- Optional: Tradeable vesting NFTs (future feature)

**Auto-Staking Bonus (Optional):**
| Lock Duration | Bonus Tokens | Total Received |
|---------------|--------------|----------------|
| Stake 3 months | +5% | 105% of allocation |
| Stake 6 months | +10% | 110% of allocation |
| Stake 12 months | +20% | 120% of allocation |

**Why This Works:**
✅ Reduces sell pressure (75% locked, not dumped)
✅ Rewards long-term believers (auto-staking bonus)
✅ Creates engaged governance (veFUNDE holders vote on milestones)
✅ Aligns incentives (holders earn yields from project success)

#### **25% of USDC paired with tokens in liquidity pool**
Establishing immediate price discovery and enabling trading from day one on Aerodrome DEX.

**Liquidity Details:**
- **DEX:** Aerodrome (Base chain)
- **Pair:** TOKEN/USDC
- **Lock:** 6-12 months (prevents rug pulls)
- **Depth:** 25% of raise ensures healthy trading
- **Ownership:** Protocol-owned liquidity (POL)

**Example:**
- Project raises $100K
- $25K USDC + matching TOKEN supply → Liquidity pool
- Immediate price discovery and trading
- Deep liquidity from day 1

#### **The liquidity, remaining funds, and minting rights are controlled by DAO**
On-chain governance from day one. veTOKEN holders (your backers) control:

**DAO Powers:**
- ✅ **Treasury funds** (65% locked in milestone escrow)
- ✅ **Token minting rights** (future emissions, if needed)
- ✅ **Project direction** (milestone approval votes)
- ✅ **Future fundraising** (OTC deals, additional rounds)
- ✅ **Protocol parameters** (fees, incentives, etc.)

**Milestone-Based Treasury Protection:**
- **35% unlocked immediately** (development funds, marketing, team)
- **65% locked in escrow** (released by achieving milestones)
- **3-attempt limit** (fail 3x → funds return to community)
- **Anti-rug protection** (can't dump treasury and disappear)

**Why This Works:**
✅ Immediate liquidity (25% paired at launch)
✅ Gradual unlock (65% milestone-gated prevents dumps)
✅ Community control (DAO votes on releases)
✅ Safety net (failed milestones → FUNDE buyback)

## 🏗️ Section 3: Build

### **How projects grow and deliver value**

#### **Creators submit milestone completion proofs**
Projects demonstrate progress through verifiable deliverables: code commits, product demos, audits, or third-party verification.

**Milestone Examples:**
- **Tech:** Smart contracts deployed and audited
- **Product:** Beta launch with 1,000+ users
- **Growth:** $100K TVL or $50K trading volume
- **Partnerships:** Integration with 3+ protocols
- **Documentation:** Complete developer docs published

**Verification Methods:**
- GitHub commits (public repositories)
- On-chain metrics (TVL, volume, transactions)
- Third-party audits (security, code quality)
- Product demos (video walkthroughs)
- Community testing (open beta access)

#### **veTOKEN holders vote on milestone releases**
Your community evaluates whether milestones were truly achieved before unlocking the next funding tranche.

**Voting Process:**
1. Creator submits proof + requests release
2. 7-day community discussion period
3. veTOKEN holders vote (20% quorum + 51% approval)
4. If approved → Funds released ✅
5. If rejected → Retry after 1 week (up to 3 attempts)
6. If rejected 3x → Treasury → FUNDE buyback (benefits protocol)

**Voting Power:**
- Lock duration matters (longer = more power)
- Participation history (active voters = more weight)
- Skin in game (veTOKEN holders own the project)

**Why This Works:**
✅ Transparency (all proofs public and verifiable)
✅ Accountability (must deliver or lose funding)
✅ Community alignment (voters benefit from good decisions)
✅ Economic deterrent (manipulation costs more than benefit)

#### **Governance decisions made by veTOKEN holders**
Standard voting for protocol parameters, spending proposals, and strategic direction.

**What You Can Vote On:**
- Milestone completion (unlock next funding tranche)
- Spending proposals (how to use treasury funds)
- Protocol changes (fee structure, incentives)
- Partnerships (which protocols to integrate with)
- OTC deals (approve post-TGE VC investments)

**Advanced (v2 Feature): Decision Markets (Futarchy-Inspired)**
> *Coming in future version - not MVP*

Market-driven governance where community trades on proposal outcomes:

**How Decision Markets Work:**
1. **Dual Markets Created** - Each proposal gets "pass" and "fail" markets
2. **Trade with FUNDE + USDC** - Stake on outcomes you believe in
3. **Price Determines Outcome** - Proposal passes if FUNDE price higher in "pass" market
4. **Market-Driven Wisdom** - Collective intelligence guides decisions

**Example Decision Market:**
- Proposal: "Spend $50K USDC on marketing campaign"
- Pass market: FUNDE trades at $1.20
- Fail market: FUNDE trades at $1.10
- Result: Proposal passes (market believes it increases value)

#### **Anti-Rug Protection Built-In**
If the founder rugs or abandons the project, veTOKEN holders can vote to liquidate the treasury and return USDC to tokenholders.

**Safety Mechanisms:**
- **3-attempt limit** (fail milestones 3x → liquidation vote)
- **Treasury controlled by DAO** (founder can't unilaterally withdraw)
- **Community override** (can force liquidation if founder MIA)
- **Automatic buyback** (rejected projects → FUNDE buyback → deflation)

**Liquidation Process:**
1. 3 failed milestone votes OR founder abandons project
2. Community raises liquidation proposal
3. veTOKEN holders vote (simple majority)
4. If approved → Treasury USDC returned to holders
5. Remaining funds → FUNDE buyback (benefits protocol)

**Why This Works:**
✅ Founder accountability (can't rug or disappear)
✅ Community safety net (can recover funds)
✅ Protocol benefits (buyback reduces FUNDE supply)
✅ Deterrent effect (bad actors know they'll fail)

## 💰 Section 4: Post-TGE Funding (Phase 2)

### **Strategic OTC Deals with VCs**
1-3 months after successful launch, proven projects can raise additional capital from top-tier VCs.

#### **Reserve Allocation:**
- **10-15% of total supply** reserved for post-TGE OTC deals
- **Target:** $2-3M from top-tier VCs
- **Timing:** After proven traction (volume, users, projects)

#### **Deal Structure:**
**Pricing:** Spot market or 10-20% premium (NO discounts!)
- VCs pay current market price or higher
- Community votes on pricing (rejects discounts)
- Transparent and fair to all stakeholders

**Execution:** TWAP method (24-48 hour gradual purchase)
- Time-Weighted Average Price prevents manipulation
- Gradual buying over 24-48 hours
- No market dumps or front-running

**Vesting:** Minimal or none (VCs buy at premium = aligned incentives)
- 0-6 month vesting depending on premium paid
- Buying at 20%+ premium = no vesting required
- Why? No dump incentive if bought above market

**Approval:** DAO governance vote required
- veFUNDE holders vote on each OTC deal
- 20% quorum + 51% approval needed
- Community controls dilution and pricing

#### **Target Investors:**
**Top-Tier VCs:**
- Paradigm, Variant, Framework, Dragonfly
- Coinbase Ventures (Base ecosystem)
- Robot Ventures, Nascent (fair launch advocates)

**Must meet minimum requirements:**
- Post-TGE OTC fundraising only (no pre-launch)
- High quality strategic value (not just capital)
