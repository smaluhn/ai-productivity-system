# FunDeFi Project Materials

This folder contains all strategic and private documents related to the FunDeFi project. It's symlinked to `/fundefi/fundefi-spec-docs/private` for seamless integration with the main project workspace.

## Structure

### Core Strategy Documents
- `BUDGET.md` - Project budget and financial planning
- `DECISION-MARKETS-FUTARCHY.md` - Decision market mechanics
- `METADAO-MECHANICS.md` - DAO governance structure
- `POST-TGE-OTC-STRATEGY.md` - Post-token generation strategies
- `PRIVATE-FUNDRAISING-STRATEGY.md` - Fundraising approach and targets
- `TASKS-AND-DECISIONS.md` - Project task tracking and decision log
- `WEBSITE-HOW-IT-WORKS.md` - Website functionality documentation

### People & Meetings
- `werner/` - Files related to Werner Vermaak (CMC) collaboration
  - `WERNER-VERMAAK-CMC-RESEARCH.md` - Background research and profile
  - `MEETING-AGENDA-2025-10-29.md` - Meeting agenda and notes

## Sync Setup

This folder is:
1. **Tracked** in the productivity-system repository (auto-synced to GitHub)
2. **Symlinked** to `fundefi/fundefi-spec-docs/private` for project access
3. **Ignored** in the fundefi repository (.gitignore excludes `private/`)

## Benefits

- ✅ All FunDeFi materials centralized in productivity system
- ✅ Accessible from both contexts (productivity workflow + project work)
- ✅ Auto-synced via productivity-system's GitHub integration
- ✅ Private materials stay out of public fundefi repositories
- ✅ Version controlled and backed up via productivity-system

## Usage

Work on FunDeFi materials from either location:
- From productivity system: `~/git/productivity-system/fundefi-project/`
- From FunDeFi project: `~/git/fundefi/fundefi-spec-docs/private/`

Changes made in either location are immediately available in both due to the symlink.
