- Advantages: Skin in game, aggregates info, reduces populism
- Disadvantages: Complex, wealth bias, manipulation risk
- Comparison: Futarchy vs traditional voting
- When it works best (economic decisions, measurable outcomes)
- FunDeFi recommendations:
  - ❌ NOT for MVP (too complex)
  - ✅ Consider for v2 (hybrid model: traditional voting + selective futarchy)
  - Good for: OTC deals, fee changes, reserve deployment
  - Keep traditional for: Milestones, project approvals

**Why Important:**
- Differentiator from other launchpads (no one else has this)
- Documented for future reference

## 🔑 Key Learnings from MetaDAO

### **1. Post-TGE OTC Strategy Works**
**MetaDAO raised $9.9M AFTER launch:**
- Paradigm: $5.9M at $7.83/token
- Variant: $2.5M at $8.60/token
- 6th Man Ventures: $1.5M at $6.35/token
- All at spot or premium (no discounts!)
- No vesting (bought at market = aligned)
- Community governance approved each deal

**Application to FunDeFi:**
- Reserve 10-15% FUNDE supply for post-TGE OTC
- Target $2-3M from 2-4 tier-1 VCs
- Same terms: Spot/premium, TWAP execution, DAO approval
- Total potential: $650K fair launch + $2-3M OTC = $2.65-3.65M

### **2. Futarchy (Decision Markets) is Powerful but Complex**
**What it is:**
- Create "approve" and "reject" markets for each proposal
- Market prices determine outcome (not votes)
- Financial skin in game (lose money if wrong)
- Aggregates information efficiently

**Pros:**
- Incentivizes research (profit if correct)
- Reduces herd effects and populism
- Objective outcomes (market prices clear)

**Cons:**
- Complex for newcomers
- Wealth bias (rich have more power)
- Not good for subjective decisions

**FunDeFi Decision:**
- ❌ NOT in MVP (start simple with veFUNDE voting)
- ✅ Consider for v2 (hybrid: traditional + selective futarchy)
- Use for economic decisions only (OTC deals, fees, etc.)

### **3. Performance-Based Team Unlocks**
**MetaDAO innovation:**
- Up to 15M tokens pre-allocated to team
- Split into 5 tranches that unlock at 2x, 4x, 8x, 16x, 32x ICO price
- Minimum 18 months before first unlock
- 3-month TWAP price (prevents manipulation)

**Why genius:**
- Team incentivized to increase price
- No unlock unless price goes up
- Community benefits (price must rise)
- Long-term alignment (18+ months)

**FunDeFi Application:**
- Consider for team allocation (15% Team & Advisors)
- Unlock tranches based on FUNDE price milestones
- Example: 1x TGE price, 3x, 5x, 10x, 20x
- Minimum 12 months before first unlock

### **4. High-Float ICO Model**
**MetaDAO philosophy:**
- Launch early with high circulating supply
- NOT high FDV, low float (bad for price)
- Grow organically over time
- Community owns majority from day 1

**Application to FunDeFi:**
- 25% liquid at TGE (fair, immediate circulation)
- 75% vesting over 9 months (not 3-4 years)
- Lower FDV initially, grows with success
- Avoids "unlock cliff" dumps

### **5. Transparent OTC Process**
**MetaDAO transparency:**
- All OTC deals public and announced
- Community votes on each deal
- Can reject (they rejected one $6M deal with 30% discount)
- VCs must pay fair prices or walk away

**Application to FunDeFi:**
- All OTC deals require DAO vote
- Public proposals with full terms
- Community can reject unfair pricing
- Transparency builds trust
