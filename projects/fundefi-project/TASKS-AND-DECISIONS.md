## 🔥 Critical Decisions Needed (ASAP)

### **1. Team Compensation Structure**
**Status:** ⚠️ URGENT - Budget shows team costs exceed allocation

**✅ UPDATE (2025-10-29):**
- **Total raise:** $650K (finalized)
- **Salary budget:** $50K cash (from $400K dev budget)
- **Actual team costs:** $114K needed for 12 months
- **Gap:** $64K shortfall
- **Proposed solution:** 8% FUNDE token allocation (4-year vest, 1-year cliff)

**Team:**
- **Werner (CMC)** - CMO - $1K/mo ($12K/year) + 1.0% FUNDE
- **Asal (Base)** - CBDO - $1K/mo ($12K/year) + 1.0% FUNDE
- **Thuy** - BD - $500/mo ($6K/year) + 0.5% FUNDE
- **Simon** - CEO - $2K/mo ($24K/year) + 1.5% FUNDE
- **Andrey** - CTO - $3K/mo ($36K/year) + 1.5% FUNDE
- **Sebastian** - AI & Blockchain - $2K/mo ($24K/year) + 1.0% FUNDE

**Remaining Decisions:**
- [ ] Confirm individual token allocations (6.5% proposed, recommend 8%)
- [ ] Vesting schedule details (4-year vest, 1-year cliff?)
- [ ] Can we reduce cash further and increase tokens to 10%?
- [ ] Part-time vs full-time for Werner, Asal, Thuy?

**Timeline:** Before fundraising starts

### **2. Launchpad Selection (Platforms 6 & 7)**
**Status:** ⚠️ URGENT - Need to finalize 7 launchpads

**✅ UPDATE (2025-10-29):**
- **Total external:** $550K across 7 platforms
- **FunDeFi platform:** $100K (2 rounds: whitelist + public cleanup)
- **Total combined:** $650K

**Confirmed:**
1. ✅ CryptoRank ($100K, $10K listing fee)
2. ✅ DAO Maker ($80K)
3. ✅ TrustSwap ($70K) - increased
4. ✅ Polkastarter ($70K) - increased
5. ✅ Seedify ($70K) - increased
6. ❓ **Platform 6** ($80K) - TBD
7. ❓ **Platform 7** ($80K) - TBD
8. ✅ FunDeFi (own platform, $100K, 2 rounds)

**Candidates for Platform 6 & 7:**
- [ ] **Fjord Foundry** (fair launch focus)
- [ ] **GameFi** (if we target gaming projects)
- [ ] **RedKite** (multi-chain)
- [ ] **Enjinstarter** (gaming/metaverse)
- [ ] **BSCPad** (if we go multi-chain)
- [ ] **Base-specific launchpad** (ecosystem alignment)

**Research Needed:**
- [ ] Fees for each platform
- [ ] Reach/community size
- [ ] Requirements (KYC, vetting, etc.)
- [ ] Timeline (how long to get listed?)

**Decision Required:** Which 2 platforms for spots 6 & 7?

**Timeline:** Next 2 weeks

### **3. Auto-Staking Bonus Percentages**
**Status:** 🟡 MEDIUM - New feature, needs finalization

**Current Proposal:**
| Lock Duration | Bonus Tokens |
|---------------|--------------|
| No stake | 0% |
| 3 months | +5% |
| 6 months | +10% |
| 12 months | +20% |

**Open Questions:**
- [ ] Are these % too high? Too low?
- [ ] Should we add 24-month option (+30%)?
- [ ] Where do bonus tokens come from? (Team allocation? Emissions?)
- [ ] Smart contract complexity/audit cost?
- [ ] Does this create unfair advantage for whales?

**Decision Required:** Finalize bonus structure & token source

**Timeline:** Before smart contract development

---

### **4. Reserve Fund Deployment Policy**
**Status:** 🟡 MEDIUM - Critical for reputation, needs clear rules

**Current Concept:**
- $200K-$250K reserve fund
- Buy unsold allocations to ensure projects "fully funded"
- Prevents "failed launch" perception

**Open Questions:**
- [ ] **Threshold:** What % shortfall triggers deployment? (e.g., only if raised >60%?)
- [ ] **Custody:** Multi-sig wallet? Who are signers?
- [ ] **Deployment price:** Same as community? Or discount?
- [ ] **Staking:** Do reserve-bought tokens get staked as veFUNDE?
- [ ] **Transparency:** How to communicate without signaling weakness?
- [ ] **Replenishment:** How do successful projects refill reserve?
- [ ] **Cap per project:** Max $50K support per project?

**Decision Required:** Written policy document with clear triggers

**Timeline:** Before first project launch

---

### **5. Liquidity Strategy Details**
**Status:** 🟡 MEDIUM - Affects tokenomics & security

**Current Plan:**
- 25% of raise → Liquidity
- Paired on Aerodrome (Base DEX)
- FUNDE/USDC pool

**Open Questions:**
- [ ] **Lock duration:** 6 months? 12 months? Forever?
- [ ] **Ownership:** Protocol-owned liquidity (POL) or community-owned?
- [ ] **Who controls LP tokens?** Multi-sig?
- [ ] **Rewards:** Do LP tokens earn Aerodrome rewards? Keep or distribute?
- [ ] **If we raise $700K:** Is $175K liquidity enough? Too much?
- [ ] **Emergency exit:** Can we ever remove liquidity? Under what conditions?

**Decision Required:** Liquidity lock policy & ownership structure

**Timeline:** Before TGE

---

### **6. VE NFT Tokenomics Integration**
**Status:** 🟢 LOW - Optional feature, research phase

**Concept (from Selena Finance):**
- 25% liquid tokens at TGE
- 75% as tradeable VE NFTs (3/6/9 month vesting)
- NFTs represent vesting positions
- Can trade NFT = sell your vesting position

**Open Questions:**
- [ ] Do we use this for FUNDE raise? Or just for projects launching on us?
- [ ] Smart contract complexity (NFT + vesting + trading)?
- [ ] Audit costs (likely higher)?
- [ ] How does this interact with veFUNDE staking?
- [ ] Do VE NFT holders get voting rights?
- [ ] What happens to VE NFTs if milestones fail?

**Decision Required:** Include in v1 or defer to v2?

**Timeline:** Before smart contract architecture finalized

## ❓ Open Questions (No Urgency)

### **Tokenomics:**
1. Should auto-staking bonus come from Team allocation or separate pool?
2. What's the ideal FUNDE total supply? (100M? 1B?)
3. Do we need deflationary mechanics beyond failed project buybacks?
4. Should we have a max supply or infinite (like Curve)?

### **Governance:**
5. What's minimum veFUNDE required to submit project proposal? (anti-spam)
6. Should we implement quadratic voting? (reduce whale power)
7. What happens if a proposal gets 51% yes but low turnout? (quorum issue)
8. Can we delegate veFUNDE voting power? (like Snapshot)

### **Technical:**
9. Multi-chain from day 1 or start with Base only?
10. Do we build our own DEX or always use Aerodrome?
11. Oracle for milestone verification or trusted committee?
12. Upgradeable contracts or immutable?

### **Business Model:**
13. What % fee do we charge projects? (10%? 15%?)
14. Do we take fee in USDC, project tokens, or both?
15. Should we offer premium tiers (faster launches, more support)?
16. Do we need a DAO for FunDeFi protocol governance?

### **Marketing:**
17. Should we target specific verticals (DeFi? Gaming? AI?)
18. Is "FunDeFi" the right name? (fun + DeFi)
19. Do we need mascot/character for brand?
20. Should we launch a podcast/content series?
