🚀 Launching: AI Productivity System (Open Source)

After months of managing multiple remote teams across different projects, I built a system to solve a simple problem: converting meeting discussions into actionable tasks.

**The Problem:**
• 72-minute team meeting
• 20+ action items mentioned
• Manual tracking in spreadsheets
• Things get forgotten
• No single source of truth

**The Solution:**
An AI-powered workflow that:
1. Records meetings via Fireflies.ai
2. Extracts action items automatically
3. Creates GitHub issues with assignments
4. Tracks progress in project boards
5. Links everything back to the meeting notes

**What I'm Sharing:**
✅ Complete workflow documentation
✅ Templates for meetings and agendas
✅ GitHub organization best practices
✅ Integration guides for 15+ tools
✅ Real-world examples from my projects

**Tech Stack:**
• Fireflies for transcription
• GitHub for task management
• Google Calendar + Reclaim.ai for scheduling
• Claude Code for automation
• Obsidian for knowledge base

**Why Open Source:**
I believe productivity tools should be accessible to everyone. The basic system is free forever (MIT license). I'm planning a Pro version with advanced automation, but the core will always be free.

**Early Results:**
• 20-40 hours of manual work → 2.5 hours
• 100% task capture rate
• Clear team assignments
• Executive visibility built-in

Try it out and let me know what you think!
