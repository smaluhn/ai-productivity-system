Excellent refinement — that’s a beautiful, rhythmic form of _caṅkama_ practice. It integrates **mindfulness, balance, and rhythmic continuity** in a way that links perfectly to your seated practice.

## 👣 **Walking Meditation Prelude**

**Purpose:** Bring mindfulness into motion; synchronize steps, counting, and awareness.

1. Walk slowly and naturally, hands relaxed, eyes soft.
2. **Count each step of one foot** (e.g. left) **from 1 → 10.**
3. At _10_, immediately switch to **the other foot (right)** — start again from _1 → 10._
    
    > Example rhythm:  
    > Left 1, Right 2, Left 3… Left 10 → then Right 1, Left 2, Right 3… Right 10 → then Left 1 again…
    
4. Keep attention on **the sole’s contact and the body’s flow.**
5. Breath moves naturally with the rhythm; don’t force synchronization.

🕊 _Aim:_ establish calm, balanced awareness before sitting.
