## 🕉️ Whole-Body Jhāna → Rigpa Daily Practice

_A daily sequence combining Susokkan, Whole-Body Jhāna, Walking Meditation, Zhan Zhuang, and Transition to Rigpa._

---

### 1 Preparation (1–3 min)

- Stand or sit upright; eyes half-open.
- Recollect motivation: “May this practice bring clarity and benefit.”
- Feel feet, spine, and crown aligned; relax chest and face.

---

### 2 Standing / Zhan Zhuang (3–5 min)

- Stand as if gently suspended from the crown.
- Hands relaxed or held before the lower abdomen.
- Breathe naturally through the _whole body_.
- Sense subtle currents rising and sinking.
- If the mind is scattered, begin **Susokkan counting** (1–10 → 1).

_Purpose:_ awaken the body’s energy channels and link posture, breath, and awareness.

---

### 3 Walking Meditation with Counting (5–15 min)

- Walk at a natural pace, eyes open, gaze soft.
- Sync steps and breath: inhale = 1 step, exhale = 1 step.
- Count cycles 1 → 10 → 1 repeatedly.
- When attention stabilizes, drop counting and feel **whole-body walking** — weight shift, air touch, subtle awareness behind the eyes.
- Occasionally ask: _“Who is walking?”_ — then rest briefly in the knowing.

_Purpose:_ anchor mindfulness in movement and make walking a cue for awareness during the day.

---

### 4 Sitting Sequence (20–40 min)

#### a. Susokkan – Counting Stage (5–10 min)

- Sit comfortably, eyes open or gently lowered.
- Follow the breath through the _whole body_, counting 1–10 → 1.
- Breath energy is global, not localized.
- Thoughts quiet, body coherent, attention steady.

---

#### b. Whole-Body Awareness & Pleasure (10–20 min)

- Drop counting; maintain inclusive knowing.
- Let pleasant warmth or subtle vibration fill the body.
- Breathe ease into neglected areas until uniform comfort spreads.
- Adjust: longer exhalation if too intense, brighter inhalation if dull.
- **This is the first Jhāna (Thai Forest style):** body and mind unified, suffused with ease.

---

#### c. Stillness / Second Jhāna Flavor (5–10 min)

- As _pīti_ fades, remain with quiet _sukha_.
- Nothing to control — awareness and body one field of calm brightness.

---

#### d. Transition to Rigpa (≈ 5 min or natural)

- Let the silent question arise: **“What knows this peace?”**
- Drop the question; rest in the knowing itself.
- Eyes open, unfocused; senses undivided.
- Recognize awareness and appearances as inseparable.
- If attention collapses, return briefly to the breath, then release again.

_Now the practice shifts from doing to being — Mahamudra / Dzogchen mode._

---

### 5 Dedication & Integration (2–3 min)

- Dedicate: “May this awareness benefit all beings.”
- Feel openness while moving fingers or standing up.
- Carry the same ease into the next activity — _Jhāna in motion._

---

## 🌿 Practice Principles

|Situation|Method|Effort Level|
|---|---|---|
|Mind scattered, sleepy, active day|Strong Susokkan, clear counting|High|
|Mind stable, relaxed|Whole-body breathing, pleasure Jhāna|Moderate|
|Mind open, naturally aware|Rest as awareness itself|Minimal / none|
|Physical movement|Walking + Counting or Zhan Zhuang|Gentle, continuous mindfulness|

---

### Subtle Reminders

- **Eyes open:** keeps awareness panoramic; prevents tunnel-focus absorption.
- **Pleasure:** enjoy it as atmosphere, not as object.
- **Transitions:** returning to counting or movement is upāya (skillful means), not regression.
- **Rigpa recognition:** when awareness knows itself without effort, drop technique — let the Jhāna’s serenity shine as background radiance.

---

You can treat this as your daily rhythm:  
**Susokkan → Whole-Body Jhāna → Stillness → Rigpa → Integration.**  
Effortful when scattered, effortless when serene — practice that adapts to life’s flow.
