## 📋 Executive Summary (TL;DR)

### **The Ask:**
- **Target:** $500-700K (ideal: $700K)
- **Structure:** Angel round + grants (NO traditional VCs)
- **Timeline:** Secure "vector" first, then fundraise, then testnet, then mainnet

### **Critical Success Factors:**
1. **🔥 Base Foundation Support** - Priority #1, apply ASAP (endorsement, not funding)
2. **💰 $200K Reserve Fund** - CRITICAL for reputation (buy unsold allocations)
3. **🎯 Quality First Projects** - 3-5 successful launches before scaling
4. **👥 Core Team of 6** - Werner (CMO), Asal (CBDO), Thuy (BD), Simon (CEO), Andrey (CTO), Sebastian (AI/Blockchain)
5. **📱 Separate Brand** - FunDeFi social media (not Favos)

### **Key Insights from Thuy:**
- Need **"vector"** (endorser/backer) before fundraising, not VC investor
- Reserve fund is **make-or-break** for reputation
- Bootstrap approach: small quality projects → build track record → scale
- Avoid traditional VCs (too much control)
- Focus on airdrop marketing ($10-20K), not paid KOLs
- Consider **Selena Finance VE NFT model** (25% tokens + 75% vesting NFTs)

### **Next 3 Actions:**
1. Apply for Base Foundation grants/ecosystem program
2. Research Selena Finance tokenomics model
3. Create 1-page pitch for Thuy review

## 🎯 Fundraising Target: $500-700K (Optimal: $700K)

### **Updated Target (From Fireflies Transcript):**
> "Ideally raise 700K... 500K bare minimum, 700K preferred for better liquidity and runway"

### **Detailed Breakdown:**

| Allocation | Amount | Purpose | Notes |
|------------|--------|---------|-------|
| **Operations Run** | $300K | 12-month runway | Core expenses, team salaries, infrastructure |
| **Liquidity Pool (FUNDE)** | $100-150K | Initial DEX liquidity | 25-30% of total raise |
| **Reserve Fund** | $200K | Buy unsold allocations | **CRITICAL for reputation** |
| **Market Maker** | $6-9K | 1-2 months @ $3K/mo | Optional but helpful for stability |
| **Marketing Budget** | $10-20K | Airdrop campaigns | Post-fundraise allocation |
| **Team Compensation** | TBD | From operations | Werner (CMO), Asal (CBDO), Thuy (BD), Simon (CEO), Andrey (CTO), Sebastian (AI/Blockchain) |
| **TOTAL** | **$616K-679K** | | Target $700K for cushion |

### **Why $700K vs $500K:**
- **More liquidity:** 25-30% = $175K vs $125K (better depth)
- **Bigger reserve:** Can buy more unsold allocations (builds confidence)
- **Marketing budget:** Room for KOL campaigns and airdrops
- **Longer runway:** Full 12 months without tight constraints

## 💼 Advisor/Backer Strategy - "The Vector"

### **Critical Requirement (From Thuy):**
> "You need to have a backer (not funder, but like advisor, or endorsing, etc reputable names, could be blockchain also)."

### **The "Vector" Concept:**
Thuy's terminology: A **"vector"** = endorser/backer who provides:
- **Social proof** (not necessarily funding)
- **Network access** (intros to projects, investors)
- **Credibility signal** (validates us to others)
- **Strategic guidance** (how to navigate ecosystem)

**This is NOT:**
- A VC who invests money
- A paid advisor with formal contract
- A board member with governance rights

**This IS:**
- A respected name publicly supporting us
- Someone who opens doors and makes intros
- An ecosystem champion who believes in vision
- Could be L1 foundation, successful founder, or respected builder

### **Why This Matters:**
- **Credibility:** Validates the project to VCs/investors
- **Network:** Opens doors to quality projects & capital
- **Expertise:** Guidance on pitfalls & best practices
- **Marketing:** Name recognition attracts participants
- **Foundation support:** Critical for L1 grants and ecosystem visibility

### **Target Advisor Profile:**

**🔥 Priority 1: Base Foundation (L1 Support)**
> "Foundation backing is critical - not for funding, but for social proof and ecosystem support"

- [ ] **Base Foundation** - Apply for grants, ecosystem support
  - Social media endorsement (retweets, features)
  - Intro to Base ecosystem projects
  - No money needed - just recognition
  - **Action:** Apply through official channels
  - **Timeline:** ASAP, before fundraising

**Tier 1 (Dream "Vectors"):**
- [ ] **Jesse Pollak** (Base lead at Coinbase)
- [ ] **Andre Cronje** (Solidly, ve(3,3) pioneer)
- [ ] **Aerodrome Core Team** (our DEX partner on Base)
- [ ] **Coinbase Ventures** (Base ecosystem focus)
- [ ] **Framework Ventures** (DeFi-focused VC)

**Tier 2 (Realistic "Vectors"):**
- [ ] Base ecosystem builders with credibility
- [ ] Successful launchpad founders (DAO Maker, Polkastarter alumni)
- [ ] DeFi protocol founders on Base
- [ ] Curve/Convex ecosystem builders
- [ ] Respected Base community members

**Tier 3 (KOL "Vectors"):**
- [ ] Ansem (crypto KOL, backed MetaDAO)
- [ ] CRG (crypto KOL, backed MetaDAO)
- [ ] Cobie (respected voice)
- [ ] Degen Spartan
- [ ] Base-focused influencers

### **Advisor Compensation:**
- 0.5-1% FUNDE (from 15% Team & Advisors allocation)
- 4-year veFUNDE vesting
- Monthly engagement requirement (1-2 calls, introductions)

### **Action Items:**
- [ ] Create advisor pitch deck
- [ ] Identify warm introductions (who do we know?)
- [ ] Draft advisor agreement template
- [ ] Prioritize top 5 targets for outreach

## 🪙 Tokenomics Model - VE NFT Structure

### **Selena Finance Model (From Transcript):**
> "Look at Selena Finance tokenomics - they do 25% tokens + 75% VE NFTs"

**Structure:**
- **25% Liquid Tokens** (immediate, tradeable)
- **75% VE NFTs** (vesting positions as NFTs)
  - 3-month lockup NFT
  - 6-month lockup NFT
  - 9-month lockup NFT
  - Users choose which vesting schedule at purchase

**Why This Works:**
- ✅ Reduces immediate sell pressure (only 25% liquid)
- ✅ Creates long-term holders (75% locked)
- ✅ NFTs are tradeable (liquidity for vesting positions)
- ✅ Users choose lockup = more flexibility
- ✅ Aligns buyers with project success

**Application to FunDeFi Launches:**
- Projects can offer this tokenomics structure
- Reduces pump-and-dump risk
- Appeals to serious investors (not just flippers)
- Creates natural holding incentive

**Research Priority:**
- [ ] Study Selena Finance full model
- [ ] Understand NFT mechanics
- [ ] How to integrate with our milestone system
- [ ] Smart contract requirements

### **Meeting 1: Costs, Budget, Liquidity**

**Fundraising Amount:**
- Target: $500-700K (ideal: $700K)
- Minimum viable: $500K
- Why more is better: More liquidity, bigger reserve, marketing budget

**Operations Run ($300K):**
- 12-month runway
- Team salaries (Werner as CMO, CTO, CEO, Base team member)
- Infrastructure costs
- Smart contract audits
- Legal/compliance

**Liquidity Requirements ($100-150K):**

- Example: $500K raise = $125K liquidity
- Example: $700K raise = $175K liquidity
- Paired with FUNDE token on Aerodrome DEX

**Reserve Fund ($200K) - CRITICAL:**
> "You need to buy allocation yourself if no one buys it - for reputation"
- If project doesn't sell out → Protocol buys remaining allocation
- Prevents "failed launch" perception
- Builds trust with future projects
- Shows commitment and confidence
- **This is make-or-break for reputation**

**Market Maker ($3K/month):**
- Optional but helpful
- 1-2 months engagement initially
- Provides stability and reduces volatility
- Total: $6-9K budget

**Marketing Budget ($10-20K):**
- Post-fundraise allocation
- Focus: Airdrop campaigns (not traditional KOL)
- Organic growth through community
- RefLink system handles most marketing

### **Meeting 2: Foundation, Team, Timeline**

**"Vector" Requirement:**
> "You need a backer - not funder, but endorser with reputable name"

- **Andrey:** CTO (Chief Technology Officer - smart contracts, backend, infrastructure)
- **Sebastian:** AI & Blockchain Lead (AI integrations, blockchain architecture)
- Total: 6 core team members

**Bootstrap Strategy:**
- Start with small, high-quality projects
- Use reserve fund to ensure success

**Social Media Strategy:**
> "Need separate social media for FunDeFi, not Favos"

- Werner leads community building
- Focus on builders and projects, not speculators

**Red Flags to Avoid:**
- Don't launch without foundation backing
- Don't skip the reserve fund (critical!)

- Don't do traditional VC rounds (lose control)
