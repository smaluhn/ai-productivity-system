**For:** Simon, Thuy, Core Team
**Status:** CONFIDENTIAL - Do NOT commit
**Last Updated:** 2025-10-29
**Purpose:** Detailed budget breakdown for $500-700K raise

---

## 💰 Total Raise Target: $650K

### **Fundraising Strategy:**
1. Raise on **7 external launchpads** → $550K total
2. Raise on **FunDeFi platform (ourselves)** → $100K
3. **Same fair launch price** across all platforms
4. **Total goal:** $650K combined

### **FunDeFi Platform Raise ($100K) - 2 Rounds:**

**Round 1: Whitelist Only**
- **Target:** $100K (or $80-90K if some left for Round 2)
- **Who can participate:** Whitelisted addresses only
  - Partners (strategic supporters)
  - KOLs (influencers we partnered with)
  - Early community (Telegram + email + wallet collected)
  - Team referrals
- **Benefit:** Eligible for GMA (Guaranteed Minimum Allocation)
- **Timing:** ASAP (potentially with launchpad partner to get $50K early for marketing)

**Round 2: Public Cleanup (Optional)**
- **Target:** $10-20K (if Round 1 doesn't fill completely)
- **Who can participate:** Anyone (no whitelist required)
- **Same price:** No discount (fair launch principle)
- **No GMA:** First-come-first-served for remaining allocation

**Why 2 Rounds:**
- ✅ Rewards early supporters (whitelist + GMA)
- ✅ Ensures full raise (public cleanup if needed)
- ✅ Maintains fairness (same price both rounds)
- ✅ Creates urgency (whitelist fills fast → FOMO for Round 2)

### **Tokenomics for Fundraise:**
- **25% liquid tokens** at TGE (immediately tradeable OR auto-stakeable)
- **75% veFUNDE staked** (vesting schedule):
  - 25% unlock after 3 months
  - 25% unlock after 6 months
  - 25% unlock after 9 months
  - Total vesting: 9 months for full unlock

### **Auto-Staking Bonus (NEW):**
> Funders can choose to stake their 25% liquid tokens at TGE for bonus rewards

**Options at TGE:**
1. **Take 25% liquid** → Trade immediately (no bonus)
2. **Auto-stake 25% liquid** → Stake as veFUNDE and get bonus

**Bonus Structure:**
| Lock Duration | Bonus Tokens | Total Received | Notes |
|---------------|--------------|----------------|-------|
| **No stake** | 0% | 100% of allocation | Liquid immediately |
| **Stake 3 months** | +5% | 105% of allocation | Extra 5% for staking |
| **Stake 6 months** | +10% | 110% of allocation | Extra 10% for staking |
| **Stake 12 months** | +20% | 120% of allocation | Extra 20% for staking |

**Example:**
- You buy $10,000 worth of FUNDE
- Normally get: 25% liquid + 75% veFUNDE (9-month vesting)
- **With auto-stake (12 months):**
  - 0% liquid immediately
  - 95% veFUNDE (9-month vesting, original 75% + 20% of 25%)
  - 20% bonus veFUNDE (12-month lock)
  - Total: 115% → You get 15% extra for full commitment

**Why This Works:**
- ✅ Reduces sell pressure at TGE (more people stake)
- ✅ Rewards long-term believers (bonus tokens)
- ✅ Creates deeper liquidity for veFUNDE voting power
- ✅ Aligns funders with protocol success
- ✅ Simple choice at TGE (stake or don't)

## 💼 Team Budget (From Salaries Line Item)

### **Team Structure:**
- **Werner (CMC)** - CMO (Chief Marketing Officer)
- **Asal (Base)** - CBDO (Chief Business Development Officer)
- **Thuy** - BD (Business Development)
- **Simon** - CEO (Chief Executive Officer)
- **Andrey** - CTO (Chief Technology Officer)
- **Sebastian** - AI & Blockchain Lead

### **Salary Allocation ($50K cash budget):**

| Role | Person | Monthly Cash | 12 Months | Token Comp | Notes |
|------|--------|--------------|-----------|------------|-------|
| **CTO** | Andrey | $3K | $36K | 1.5% FUNDE | Full-time, lead dev |
| **CEO** | Simon | $2K | $24K | 1.5% FUNDE | Full-time, operations |
| **CMO** | Werner | $1K | $12K | 1.0% FUNDE | Part-time, marketing |
| **CBDO** | Asal | $1K | $12K | 1.0% FUNDE | Part-time, BD |
| **BD** | Thuy | $500 | $6K | 0.5% FUNDE | Advisory/part-time |
| **AI/Blockchain** | Sebastian | $2K | $24K | 1.0% FUNDE | Full-time, technical |
| **TOTAL** | | | **$114K** | **6.5% FUNDE** | Need $64K more or cut scope |

### **⚠️ STILL A GAP: $114K needed vs $50K budget**

**Solutions:**
1. **Increase token allocation:** Give team 8-10% FUNDE instead of 6.5%
2. **Part-time initially:** Some members join full-time post-TGE
3. **Deferred cash:** Pay $50K now, owe $64K post-TGE (risky)
4. **Reduce scope:** Start with 3-4 members, hire others later

**Recommended Final Approach:**
- **Cash budget:** $50K for first 6 months (ultra-lean)
- **Token allocation:** 8% FUNDE (vested 4 years, 1-year cliff)
- **Post-TGE:** Increase salaries or hire additional members
- **Priority:** Andrey (CTO) and Sebastian (AI/Blockchain) full cash, others token-heavy

## 🏦 Reserve Fund Strategy

### **Purpose of $200K-$250K Reserve:**
> "You need to buy allocation yourself if no one buys it - for reputation"

**How It Works:**
1. Project launches on FunDeFi, targeting $100K raise
2. Only $70K sold to community
3. **FunDeFi protocol buys remaining $30K** from reserve
4. Result: Project shows "fully funded" ✅
5. Builds confidence for next projects

### **Reserve Fund Allocation:**

| Scenario | Reserve Amount | Projects Supported | Avg Support per Project |
|----------|----------------|-------------------|-------------------------|
| **$650K Raise** | $200,000 | 4-6 projects | $33K-$50K top-up each |

### **Reserve Deployment Criteria:**
- Only deploy if project is **quality** (passed veFUNDE vote)
- Only if shortfall is **<40%** (e.g., raised $60K+ of $100K target)
- Reserve buys at **same price** as community (fair)
- Reserve FUNDE holdings are **staked as veFUNDE** (long-term aligned)
- Earnings from successful projects **replenish reserve**

## 📈 Liquidity Strategy

### **Post-TGE Liquidity:**
> Note: Liquidity comes from development budget ($20K seed) + additional from 25% rule

| Total Raise | Seed Liquidity | Additional Needed | Total Liquidity | Notes |
|-------------|----------------|-------------------|-----------------|-------|
| **$650K** | $20,000 | ~$142,500 | $162,500 | 25% of raise, DEX only |

### **Liquidity Details:**
- **DEX:** Aerodrome (Base chain)
- **Token Pair:** FUNDE/USDC
- **Lock:** 6-12 months (prevents rug)
- **Ownership:** Protocol-owned liquidity (POL)
- **Market Maker:** $10K budget (3-4 months @ $3K/mo)
- **No CEX:** DEX only initially

### **Token Distribution at TGE:**
- **Fundraise participants:** 25% liquid immediately (or auto-stake for bonus)
- **Liquidity pool:** Paired at TGE on Aerodrome
- **Remaining 75%:** Staked as veFUNDE (vesting 3/6/9 months)
