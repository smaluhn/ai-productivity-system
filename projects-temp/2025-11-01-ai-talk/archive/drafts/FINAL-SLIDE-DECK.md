[Bottom banner - Orange/Warning color]
⚠️ CONCEPT: AkunIndo AI Expense Tracker (launching soon)
Target: Save 90%+ of bookkeeping time for Indonesian SMEs
```

### Design Notes:
- Split screen: 50/50
- Left side: Red tint (#FEE2E2)
- Right side: Green tint (#D1FAE5)
- **IMPORTANT:** Bottom banner clarifies this is a CONCEPT/TARGET
- Use "~2 min target" not "2 min actual"
- Use "concept" language throughout

**What to Say:**
"Here's what we're BUILDING with AkunIndo. We haven't launched yet, but this shows our HYPOTHESIS: if we can automate receipt scanning with AI, we could save Indonesian freelancers 90% of their bookkeeping time. From 30 minutes down to 2 minutes. That's the GOAL - and that's how you should think about AI for your village."

---

## SLIDE 5: AKUNINDO - THE HYPOTHESIS

### Visual Layout:
```
[CENTER - Large, but not claiming it's proven]

OUR TARGET:
90%+ Time Saved

[Below - Medium, 40pt]
Traditional: 30 minutes
With AI Goal: ~2 minutes

[Below - Regular, 28pt]
IF WE'RE RIGHT:
✅ Users could find 10-20% unnecessary expenses
✅ Clear, measurable ROI
✅ Real business impact

[Bottom right - Small, highlighted]
For Pinge Village:
Same principle → Automate repetitive tasks
Test with ONE task first (like FAQs)
```

### Design Notes:
- Background: White
- Main text: "OUR TARGET" or "OUR HYPOTHESIS" (not claiming proven)
- Use softer language: "could", "target", "goal"
- Blue color (#2563EB) instead of green (since unproven)
- Bottom tip emphasizes the PRINCIPLE, not the exact numbers

**What to Say:**
"This is our HYPOTHESIS. We think we can save 90% of time. We haven't proven it yet - we're still testing. But the PRINCIPLE is what matters for you: identify your most time-consuming task, think about how AI could automate it, then TEST it. Don't trust my numbers - run your own test!"

## SLIDE 6: PRINTORA - DATA CONCEPT

└────────────────────┴─────────────────────┘

[Bottom banner - Blue background]
Printora.ai - AI Design Platform (Concept)
PRINCIPLE: Use data to make decisions, not guesses
```

### Design Notes:
- Left: Gray background (#F3F4F6), confused emoji
- Right: White background, charts/data icons
- **Changed:** Don't claim specific numbers (40%, 25%)
- Focus on the PRINCIPLE not specific results
- Bottom banner: Emphasize the concept/principle

**What to Say:**
"With Printora, we're building an AI design platform. I don't have proven conversion numbers yet, but the PRINCIPLE is clear: track where people quit, fix that step, measure if it improved. For Pinge: you could track where visitors drop off in your booking process. Maybe it's payment, maybe it's language, maybe it's unclear pricing. Find the dropout point, fix it, measure the change."

💡 Real programs, real money
   Apply as "community tourism innovation"

```

### Design Notes:
- Use actual company logos (download from brand sites)
- "Up to" amounts (they vary by program)
- Bottom banner: Focus on Pinge's eligibility
- Keep logos in brand colors

**What to Say:**
"Here's something concrete: major tech companies give away free AI credits. Google, AWS, Microsoft, OpenAI - they all have programs. Amounts vary, but we're talking tens of thousands of dollars in free credits. Pinge Village could apply as a 'community tourism innovation project.' One person, 2 hours of applications, could save you $50,000+ in AI costs."

[Bottom]
Your numbers will be different!
The FORMULA is what matters, not my example.
```

### Design Notes:
- Box: Light blue background (#EFF6FF)
- Border: Navy blue
- **Changed:** "Example" and "hypothetical" language
- "Potential" or "~$4,200" (approximate)
- Bottom disclaimer: Emphasize it's an example
- Calculator or money icon in corner

**What to Say:**
"Here's an EXAMPLE calculation. These aren't real numbers - they're hypothetical. YOUR numbers will be different. But the formula is simple: what time did you save, what extra revenue did you generate, what did the tech cost. Track those three things and you'll know if it's working."

| 11. Closing | 0:30 | Contact + CTA |
| **TOTAL** | **10:00** | *Perfect timing!* |

---

## 🎯 WHY THIS ORDER WORKS BETTER:

### Old Order (Slide 8):
- 3 Actions in the middle
- Then ROI formula, Human+AI, Closing
- Actions get buried, less memorable

### New Order (Slide 10):
- Build up: Examples → Principles → Resources → Formula → Philosophy
- **THEN: 3 Actions** ← Fresh in their minds!
- Closing with contact
- Last actionable thing they hear before Q&A

**Result:** They leave with concrete actions, not just your contact info!
