# 10-Min Presentation - SPEAKER NOTES (Short & Punchy)

## YOUR KEY MESSAGE:
**"AI is only valuable if you can MEASURE the results"**

---

## SLIDES + WHAT TO SAY (10 slides, ~1 min each)

### SLIDE 1: INTRO
**Visual:** Your photo + 5 company logos
**Say:** "Hi, I'm Simon. I build tech companies in Indonesia. Today: How to prove AI is worth it."

---

### SLIDE 2: THE PROBLEM
**Visual:** Big text: "Is AI Worth It?"
**Say:**
- Everyone says "use AI"
- But HOW do you know it's working?
- Today: Real examples from my companies

---

### SLIDE 3: AKUNINDO - THE PROBLEM
**Visual:** Photo of messy receipts vs clean app
**Say:**
- AI expense tracker for Indonesian SMEs
- Problem: Freelancers waste 10 hours/week on bookkeeping
- They're losing money but don't know where

---

### SLIDE 4: AKUNINDO - THE RESULTS
**Visual:**
```
BEFORE: 30 min to process receipts
AFTER: 2 min with AI scan
= 93% TIME SAVED
```
**Say:**
- We MEASURED before/after
- Users found 15% unnecessary expenses
- ROI = clear and measurable

**For Pinge Village:**
"Start with ONE task. How many hours answering 'What time is the tour?' → Automate with ChatGPT"

---

### SLIDE 5: PRINTORA - DATA WINS
**Visual:** Split screen: "Guessing" ❌ vs "Data" ✅
**Say:**
- Print-on-demand platform
- We track: What designs sell? Where do people quit?
- Data showed: 40% quit at payment → we fixed payment = 25% more sales

**For Pinge Village:**
"Track ONE thing: Where do visitors drop off? (website → booking → payment)"

---

### SLIDE 6: FREE AI CREDITS
**Visual:** Logo grid with amounts:
```
Google Cloud: $200,000
AWS: $100,000
Microsoft: $150,000
OpenAI: Grants available
```
**Say:**
- Big tech companies GIVE AWAY free AI credits
- AkunIndo got $25K free from Google
- That's our AI costs covered for 1 year
- Pinge can apply too!

---

### SLIDE 7: 3 ACTIONS FOR MONDAY
**Visual:** Big numbers 1-2-3
```
1. MEASURE ONE THING
2. START WITH FREE TOOLS
3. ASK ONE QUESTION
```
**Say:**

**1. Measure One Thing:**
- Pick most annoying repetitive task
- Count: How many times per day?
- Goal: Reduce 50% with tech

**2. Start Free:**
- WhatsApp Business = free chatbot
- Google Forms = free surveys
- ChatGPT = free translations

**3. Ask ONE Question:**
- After every tour: "What almost stopped you from booking?"
- Fix the #1 answer = biggest ROI

---

### SLIDE 8: THE ROI FORMULA
**Visual:** Simple math:
```
Time Saved × Value = ROI

Example:
10 hours/week saved × $5/hour = $50/week
+ 5 extra bookings × $30 = $150/month
Tech Cost = $0 (free tools)
─────────────────────
ROI = $4,200/year
```
**Say:**
"You don't need expensive software. Free tools + measurement = clear ROI"

---

### SLIDE 9: HUMAN + AI
**Visual:** Two hands: Human 🤝 AI
```
AI DOES:               HUMANS DO:
• Translations         • Storytelling
• FAQs                 • Hospitality
• Data                 • Cultural connection
```
**Say:**
- AI handles boring repetitive stuff
- Humans do the MEANINGFUL work
- Your village elder's story = irreplaceable
- ChatGPT just translates it to 50 languages

---

### SLIDE 10: CLOSING
**Visual:**
```
START SMALL
MEASURE EVERYTHING
USE FREE TOOLS

Contact: [your email]
akunindo.id | printora.ai
```
**Say:**
"Don't try to do everything. Pick ONE painful task. Find ONE free tool. Try ONE week. Measure the difference. That's it."

## YOUR CHEAT SHEET (Keep in pocket)

### Main Points (Don't forget!):
1. ✅ Technology only matters if you MEASURE results
2. ✅ AkunIndo example: 93% time saved (measurable)
3. ✅ Printora example: Data = better decisions
4. ✅ Free AI credits exist (Google $200K, AWS $100K)
5. ✅ 3 Actions: Measure one thing, use free tools, ask one question

### Two Questions You'll Get:

**Q1: "How to measure ROI simply?"**
**A:** "Track 3 numbers: Time saved, bookings increased, staff happiness. Simple spreadsheet. Weekly updates."

**Q2: "What ONE data point to track?"**
**A:** "The dropout point. Where do visitors almost book but don't? Fix that first."

### If You Run Out of Time:
- Skip Printora details (keep AkunIndo only)
- Skip AI credits explanation (just show the slide)
- Must keep: Problem → AkunIndo Example → 3 Actions → Closing

### Energy Tips:
- Start strong: "Everyone says use AI... but HOW?"
- Use pauses after big numbers (93% time saved... [pause])
- Point to slides when showing numbers
- End with call to action: "What will YOU measure first?"

---

## SLIDE DESIGN RULES:

### Every Slide Should Have:
- ✅ ONE main visual (photo, chart, or BIG text)
- ✅ Minimal text (max 3-5 bullet points OR 1 big number)

- ❌ NO tiny text

### Visual Ideas:
- **Before/After photos** (messy receipts vs clean app)
