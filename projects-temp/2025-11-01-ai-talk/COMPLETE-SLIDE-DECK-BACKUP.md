## SLIDE 4: AKUNINDO - CONCEPT (NOT TESTED YET)

### Visual Layout:

┌─────────────────────┬─────────────────────┐
│   TRADITIONAL       │    WITH AI          │
├─────────────────────┼─────────────────────┤
│ [Photo: Messy       │ [Mockup:            │

└─────────────────────┴─────────────────────┘

[Bottom banner - Orange/Warning color]
⚠️ CONCEPT: AkunIndo AI Expense Tracker (launching soon)
Target: Save 90%+ of bookkeeping time for Indonesian SMEs
```

### Design Notes:
- Split screen: 50/50
- Left side: Red tint (#FEE2E2)
- Right side: Green tint (#D1FAE5)
- **IMPORTANT:** Bottom banner clarifies this is a CONCEPT/TARGET
- Use "~2 min target" not "2 min actual"
- Use "concept" language throughout

**What to Say:**
"Here's what we're BUILDING with AkunIndo. We haven't launched yet, but this shows our HYPOTHESIS: if we can automate receipt scanning with AI, we could save Indonesian freelancers 90% of their bookkeeping time. From 30 minutes down to 2 minutes. That's the GOAL - and that's how you should think about AI for your village."

---

## SLIDE 5: AKUNINDO - THE HYPOTHESIS

### Visual Layout:
```
[CENTER - Large, but not claiming it's proven]

OUR TARGET:
90%+ Time Saved

[Below - Medium, 40pt]
Traditional: 30 minutes
With AI Goal: ~2 minutes

[Below - Regular, 28pt]
IF WE'RE RIGHT:
✅ Users could find 10-20% unnecessary expenses
✅ Clear, measurable ROI
✅ Real business impact

[Bottom right - Small, highlighted]
For Pinge Village:
Same principle → Automate repetitive tasks
Test with ONE task first (like FAQs)
```

### Design Notes:
- Background: White
- Main text: "OUR TARGET" or "OUR HYPOTHESIS" (not claiming proven)
- Use softer language: "could", "target", "goal"
- Blue color (#2563EB) instead of green (since unproven)
- Bottom tip emphasizes the PRINCIPLE, not the exact numbers

**What to Say:**
"This is our HYPOTHESIS. We think we can save 90% of time. We haven't proven it yet - we're still testing. But the PRINCIPLE is what matters for you: identify your most time-consuming task, think about how AI could automate it, then TEST it. Don't trust my numbers - run your own test!"

## SLIDE 6: PRINTORA - DATA CONCEPT

│ "Maybe we          │    problem first    │

└────────────────────┴─────────────────────┘

[Bottom banner - Blue background]
Printora.ai - AI Design Platform (Concept)
PRINCIPLE: Use data to make decisions, not guesses
```

### Design Notes:
- Left: Gray background (#F3F4F6), confused emoji
- Right: White background, charts/data icons
- **Changed:** Don't claim specific numbers (40%, 25%)
- Focus on the PRINCIPLE not specific results
- Bottom banner: Emphasize the concept/principle

**What to Say:**
"With Printora, we're building an AI design platform. I don't have proven conversion numbers yet, but the PRINCIPLE is clear: track where people quit, fix that step, measure if it improved. For Pinge: you could track where visitors drop off in your booking process. Maybe it's payment, maybe it's language, maybe it's unclear pricing. Find the dropout point, fix it, measure the change."

└──────────────────────┴──────────────────────┘

💡 Real programs, real money
   Apply as "community tourism innovation"
   Pinge Village is eligible!
```

### Design Notes:
- Use actual company logos (download from brand sites)
- "Up to" amounts (they vary by program)
- Bottom banner: Focus on Pinge's eligibility
- Keep logos in brand colors

**What to Say:**
"Here's something concrete: major tech companies give away free AI credits. Google, AWS, Microsoft, OpenAI - they all have programs. Amounts vary, but we're talking tens of thousands of dollars in free credits. Pinge Village could apply as a 'community tourism innovation project.' One person, 2 hours of applications, could save you $50,000+ in AI costs."

║ ⏰ Time Saved (hypothetical):      ║
║    10 hours/week × $5/hour         ║
║    = $50/week                      ║
║                                    ║

[Bottom]
Your numbers will be different!
The FORMULA is what matters, not my example.
```

### Design Notes:
- Box: Light blue background (#EFF6FF)
- Border: Navy blue
- **Changed:** "Example" and "hypothetical" language
- "Potential" or "~$4,200" (approximate)
- Bottom disclaimer: Emphasize it's an example
- Calculator or money icon in corner

**What to Say:**
"Here's an EXAMPLE calculation. These aren't real numbers - they're hypothetical. YOUR numbers will be different. But the formula is simple: what time did you save, what extra revenue did you generate, what did the tech cost. Track those three things and you'll know if it's working."

- **Slide 3:** "First, something you can use RIGHT NOW - Favors.id..."

## 🚨 EMERGENCY BACKUP:

3. Write "3 Actions" on paper
4. You know your companies - just talk!
5. Give out WhatsApp number for follow-up
