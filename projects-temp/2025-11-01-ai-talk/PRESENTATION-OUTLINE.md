## PRESENTATION STRUCTURE (10 Minutes)

### 0:00-1:00 | INTRO: The Problem with Technology (1 min)

**Opening Hook:**
"How many of you have been told to 'just use AI' but don't know where to start or if it's worth the investment?"

**Key Message:**
- Technology is only valuable if it solves real problems
- Small tourism villages need PRACTICAL, MEASURABLE solutions
- Today I'll show you exactly how to prove value, save time, and make better decisions

**Transition:** "Let me share two real businesses I'm building right now in Indonesia..."

### 1:00-3:30 | REAL-WORLD EXAMPLE 1: AkunIndo (2.5 min)

**What is AkunIndo?**
- AI Expense Tracker for Indonesian Freelancers & SMEs
- Launched in Bali, targeting small businesses
- Uses AI to scan receipts and automate bookkeeping

**The Problem We Solved:**
- Indonesian freelancers waste 5-10 hours/week on manual bookkeeping
- They don't track expenses → can't optimize costs → lose money
- Fear of technology: "Is this too complicated for me?"

**How We Proved Value (ROI):**
1. **Track Time Saved:** Users scan 20 receipts in 2 minutes vs 30 minutes manually
   - Measurable: 93% time reduction
2. **Track Money Saved:** Users found avg. 15% unnecessary expenses when data was visualized
   - Measurable: Direct cost savings
3. **Track User Behavior:** Which features are actually used? Which are ignored?
   - Data: 80% use AI scan, only 20% use manual entry

**Lesson for Pinge Village:**
- Start with ONE painful task (for you: answering repetitive questions like "What time do tours start?")
- Measure BEFORE and AFTER (how many hours staff spend answering FAQs)
- If you save 10 hours/week = that's ROI you can see and feel

**Automation Example with ChatGPT:**
- AkunIndo uses AI to automatically categorize expenses
- For Pinge: ChatGPT can auto-respond to 80% of common questions
- Example: "What's included in the tour?" → ChatGPT answers instantly in multiple languages
- Staff time freed up for actual tours, not answering emails

### 3:30-6:00 | REAL-WORLD EXAMPLE 2: Printora (2.5 min)

**What is Printora?**
- AI-Powered Design Platform for Print-on-Demand
- Helps non-designers create professional products (t-shirts, mugs, posters)
- Target: Small businesses and creators who can't afford designers

**The Problem We Solved:**
- Small businesses want to sell merchandise but design is expensive/complicated
- They don't know what customers want
- They waste money printing products that don't sell

**How We Use Data to Make Better Decisions:**
1. **Track What Sells:** Which designs get most clicks? Which actually sell?
   - Data: 10% of designs generate 70% of sales
2. **Track Customer Journey:** Where do visitors drop off? (browse → add to cart → checkout)
   - Data: 40% abandon cart at payment → we simplified payment
3. **A/B Testing:** Try two versions, see which performs better
   - Example: Green button vs Blue button → Green converts 15% better

**Lesson for Pinge Village:**
- You need to know: Which tours are most popular? Which times? Which languages?
- Simple tech can track this: Google Analytics (free), booking system with reports
- Example decision: "80% of our bookings are for morning tours → let's add more morning slots"

**The Power of Simple Data:**
- You don't need complex software
- Start with: Google Forms for feedback, simple spreadsheet to track bookings
- Ask ONE question after every tour: "Rate your experience 1-10"
- If score drops below 8 → investigate immediately

### 7:30-9:00 | THREE PRACTICAL ACTIONS FOR PINGE VILLAGE (1.5 min)

**Action 1: Measure One Thing This Week**
- Pick THE MOST ANNOYING repetitive task
- Examples: "How many times do we answer 'Where is parking?' per day?"
- Track for one week → that's your baseline
- Goal: Reduce by 50% with technology

**Action 2: Start With Free Tools**
- Don't buy expensive software yet
- Free options that work:
  - **WhatsApp Business** (free chatbot for basic FAQs)
  - **Google Forms** (free feedback surveys)
  - **ChatGPT Free** (draft tour descriptions, translate content)
  - **Canva** (free design tool for social media)
- Test for 1 month, measure results

**Action 3: Collect Visitor Data (One Question)**
- After every tour, ask: "What almost stopped you from booking?"
- Common answers reveal biggest problems:
  - "Website too slow" → optimize site
  - "No English info" → add translation
  - "Didn't know how to pay" → simplify payment
- Fix the #1 blocker first = biggest ROI

**The ROI Formula for Small Villages:**
```
ROI = (Time Saved × Hourly Value) + (New Bookings × Tour Price) - Technology Cost

Example:
- Save 10 hours/week answering FAQs (10 × $5 = $50/week saved)
- Get 5 extra bookings/month from better website (5 × $30 = $150/month)
- Technology cost: $0 (using free tools)
- Monthly ROI = $350

Annual ROI = $4,200 with ZERO investment
```

### 9:00-10:00 | CLOSING: The Human-AI Balance (1 min)

**Key Message:**
"Technology should AMPLIFY your people, not replace them."

**The Balance:**
- AI handles: Repetitive tasks, translations, data analysis
- Humans handle: Storytelling, hospitality, cultural connection
- Result: Staff have MORE time for the meaningful work that AI can't do

**Your Authentic Stories Are Irreplaceable:**
- ChatGPT can translate your village elder's story to 50 languages
- But only YOUR elder can tell it with soul
- Technology makes your authentic voice reach further

**Final Thought:**
"Start small. Measure everything. Use free resources. Focus on problems, not tools."

**Call to Action:**
"After this event, pick ONE painful task. Find ONE free tool. Try for ONE week. Measure the difference. That's how you prove value."

## QUESTIONS YOU'LL BE ASKED (Prepare Answers)

### Question 1: "What is the simplest, easiest way for Pinge Village to measure if their new AI chatbot or booking system is actually working?"

**Your Answer:**
"Track THREE simple numbers:

1. **Time Metric:** How many hours per week does staff spend on the task BEFORE vs AFTER?
   - Example: Answering FAQs: 15 hours/week → 5 hours/week = 10 hours saved

2. **Money Metric:** Did bookings increase?
   - Track: Bookings per month BEFORE vs AFTER new booking system
   - Even 3-5 extra bookings = measurable ROI

3. **Happiness Metric:** Ask your STAFF: 'Is this tool making your job easier?'
   - If staff hate it → it's not working, even if metrics look good
   - If staff love it → dig deeper to find the value

Use a simple spreadsheet. Update weekly. Review monthly. That's it."

---

### Question 2: "If Pinge Village could only start tracking ONE piece of visitor data tomorrow, what single metric would you recommend?"

**Your Answer:**
"Track **The Dropout Point** - Where do visitors almost book, but DON'T?

For online:
- Use free Google Analytics
- See: '100 people visit website → 50 view tours → 10 add to cart → 2 actually book'
- The biggest drop is your biggest opportunity
- If 50% drop at payment page → fix payment process FIRST

For in-person:
- Ask every visitor who walks away: 'What almost made you book today?'
- Track the TOP 3 reasons in a notebook
- Example answers: 'Too expensive', 'No afternoon tours', 'Can't pay with card'
- Fix the #1 reason = biggest increase in bookings

This ONE metric tells you exactly where to invest your limited time and money."
