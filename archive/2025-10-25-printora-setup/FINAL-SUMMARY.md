## ⏭️ What's Left (Requires Manual Action)

### Monday Morning (1-2 hours total)

#### 1. Get GitHub Usernames
- [ ] Ask Nhung for username

- [ ] Add them to repos (commands in MONDAY-ACTION-ITEMS.md)

#### 2. Clean Up GitHub Projects
**Current state**: 4 projects (duplicates exist)

**Target state**: 2 projects
- [ ] Keep: "Printora Development"

- [ ] Delete: printora-development, printora, @zee-mon's project

**Why**: See `GITHUB-PROJECTS-REORGANIZATION.md` for full explanation

#### 3. Link Repos to Projects
- [ ] Printora Development → link printora + printora-spec-docs
- [ ] Printora Operations → link printora-marketing + printora-spec-docs

#### 4. Upload Docs to printora-spec-docs
- [ ] Create folder structure
- [ ] Upload meeting notes

## 🎯 Key Insights & Decisions

### GitHub Projects Organization

**Key Learning**: Issues STAY in repos, Projects DISPLAY them

**Structure**:
- **Printora Development** (Project) → Shows dev issues from `printora` repo
- **Printora Operations** (Project) → Shows marketing issues from `printora-marketing` repo
- Issues in `printora-spec-docs` → Appear in BOTH projects

**Benefits**:
- Dev team sees only dev work
- Ops team sees only ops work
- No noise, clear focus
- Simon/Thuy can see both for oversight

**Access Control**:
- Thuy/Nhung don't need code repo access
- But CAN be project members
- See their tasks without seeing dev code

### Workflow Established

**From Meeting → To Done**:
1. Meeting recorded (Fireflies)
2. Transcript processed (30 min)
3. Issues created (automated)
4. Team sees in project board
5. Work progresses through columns
6. Review → Approve → Done

**Single source of truth**: GitHub for everything
