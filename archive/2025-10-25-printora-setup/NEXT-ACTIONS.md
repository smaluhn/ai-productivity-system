## ❓ Questions Needing Answers

### Critical for GitHub Issue Creation

**1. Team GitHub Usernames**
Need usernames to assign issues:
- Eko: ?
- Kevin: ?
- Yosua: ?
- Nhung: ?
- Thuy: ?

**2. Printora Repository Access**
Do all team members already have access to:
- Printora/printora
- Printora/printora-marketing
- Printora/printora-spec-docs

If not, I'll need to invite them.

**3. Existing GitHub Projects**
You mentioned:
- "Printora Development" project
- "Printora" project (marketing/admin)

Are these already created? If so, what are their URLs?

### Important for Social Media Automation

**4. Personal Website**
- Tech stack for simon.smaluhn.com?
- Blog section exists or needs creation?
- How to integrate automated posts?

**5. Private Marketing Repo**
Should I create:
- `smaluhn/marketing` (private)
- Connected to @SimonFavourse X/Twitter
- Connected to LinkedIn
- For personal brand or all projects?

## 🚀 Ready When You Are

I've done everything I can without:
1. GitHub auth permissions
2. Team GitHub usernames
3. Your review/approval

Once you provide those, I can execute the entire deployment in one session.

**What would you like to tackle first when you're back?**

Options:
A. Review everything I've created (recommended)
B. Provide auth and usernames so I can start creating GitHub issues
C. Discuss changes or improvements to the system
D. Focus on something else entirely

Let me know and I'll proceed accordingly! 🎯
