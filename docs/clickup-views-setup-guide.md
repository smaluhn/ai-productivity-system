## 🆘 Troubleshooting

**View is empty / tasks missing:**
- Check filters - might be too restrictive
- Check date range - "This Week" might not include your tasks
- Check assignee filter - make sure it includes the right people

**Too many tasks showing:**
- Add more filters (priority, due date)
- Use "Hide completed" option
- Group by status to collapse sections

**View is slow:**
- Limit to specific lists instead of "Everything"
- Reduce number of custom fields displayed
- Use "Compact" view mode

---

**Estimated setup time:** 20-30 minutes for all 8 views
**Best time to do this:** Tomorrow morning before meetings
**Owner:** Simon (then show team)

**Once done, test with:** `make morning` and see your tasks flow!
