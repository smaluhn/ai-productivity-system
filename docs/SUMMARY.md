### Meeting → Task → Completion Flow
```
1. Meeting happens (Fireflies records)
2. Process transcript → Extract action items
3. Create GitHub issues with assignees
4. Add to project board → To Do
5. Team picks tasks → In Progress
6. Complete work → Review
7. Approval → Done
8. Update CHANGELOG.md
```

### Review Hierarchy
- **Developers** → Senior dev review (technical)
- **Senior Dev** → Executive review (features/UX)
- **Marketing** → Executive review (content/messaging)
- **Strategic** → Executive approval (partnerships/direction)

### Task Organization
- **Critical**: Blocks MVP or production
- **High**: Important for current iteration
- **Medium**: Important but can wait
- **Low**: Nice to have, future consideration
