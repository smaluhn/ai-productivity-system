### Daily Workflow:

# Morning (8:00 AM)
make morning
# → Creates daily note
# → Fetches all tasks from ClickUp
# → Shows tasks organized by urgency & project
```

### How to Use:
1. **Morning:** Check today's note for tasks
2. **Work:** Focus on tasks by day (Tue=AkunIndo, Wed=FunDeFi, etc.)
3. **Update:** Check off tasks in ClickUp as you complete them
4. **Evening:** Run `make evening` to validate
5. **Tomorrow:** `make morning` refreshes with latest from ClickUp

### For Team:
1. **Assign tasks in ClickUp** (not in Slack/email!)
