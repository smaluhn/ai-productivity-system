# FunDeFi Mechanics Discussion 1/2 - 2025-10-25

**Date:** 2025-10-25 (Friday)
**Time:** 6:01 PM
**Attendees:** Simon, Thuy
**Duration:** ~4 minutes
**Fireflies Recording:** https://app.fireflies.ai/view/01K8DD2QAMKVED56YVTGMF1E67

## Overview

First part of FunDeFi tokenomics discussion covering the core staking model, revenue streams, and initial debate on emissions vs. bribes for the Fundify launchpad platform.

---

## Key Decisions Made

- **Token Ticker:** FUNDY (F-U-N-D-E for Fundify)
- **Vote Escrow Token:** VE FUNDY
- **Core Mechanism:** Stake FUNDY → Receive VE FUNDY
- **VE33 Mechanics:** Longer staking = more voting power (multiplier effect) + higher APY
- **Revenue Sources Confirmed:**
  - Launchpad fees
  - Token trading buy/sell tax fees
  - LP yield
  - Usage fees from tokens used as credits in apps
- **Revenue Distribution:** Vault distributes to token creators, Fundify protocol, and VE token stakers

---

## Key Topics Discussed

### 1. Token Structure
- Primary token: **FUNDY**
- Vote escrow token: **VE FUNDY** (obtained by staking FUNDY)

### 2. Staking Benefits for VE FUNDY Holders
- **Minimum allocation** of new tokens (GMA) on the launchpad
- **Yield earnings** from multiple revenue streams
- **Enhanced voting power** with longer staking periods (VE33 mechanics)
- **Higher APY** for longer staking commitments

### 3. Revenue Streams (Yield Sources)
All feed into a vault that distributes to:
- Token creators
- Fundify protocol
- VE token stakers

Revenue comes from:
1. **Launchpad fees** - From project fundraising
2. **Token trading fees** - Buy/sell tax on launched tokens
3. **LP yield** - From liquidity pools
4. **Usage fees** - When tokens are used for credits in apps

### 4. Emissions vs. Bribes Debate (Unresolved)
**Question:** Should we implement weekly FUNDY token emissions?

**Traditional DeFi Model:**
- Weekly FUNDY emissions go to projects receiving most VE FUNDY votes
- Creates inflation but incentivizes voting

**Alternative Model:**
- No emissions from protocol
- Projects/supporters provide bribes/incentives directly

**Status:** Needs further discussion and analysis by tokenomics sub-team

---

## Action Items

### Unassigned (Tokenomics Sub-team)
- [ ] Decide on implementing emissions of FUNDY tokens to projects based on VE FUNDY votes or opting out of emissions
- [ ] Define the structure of incentive models and bribes in relation to the emissions decision and weekly voting campaigns
- [ ] Analyze pros and cons of emissions vs. bribes model
- [ ] Prepare recommendation for next meeting

## Full Transcript

**Simon:** Okay, so the ticker is fundy F U N D E for Fundify. Then it's V Fundy is the ve. Ve fundy. VE fundy is the vote escrow token.

Then the mechanism is like this. I stake fundy token, then I receive V fundy. The benefit for the stakers are first I will get minimum allocation GMA for the new tokens to be launched on the launch pad. Second is I get a yield.

And then we have like the V33 mechanics, like longer staking, more voting power, like there's a multiplier. And then also longer staking, higher yield, higher apy.

Then where's the yield coming from? From the launchpad Fees from the token trading by sell tax fees from the LP yield. I think so. And then also from the usage.

So the fundy token or the new tokens being launched on Fundify that you know, if they be used for credits for the apps, you know that also some of it goes to the vault, right? To the newly created token vault and then that is being distributed to the like token creator to the protocol Fundify and then also to the VE token stickers. Right?

That's actually the basic model, that's the important model. And then now the question is for the like from the VE33, the emissions model and the incentives or the bribes, how to do this? Now if we. And should we do this or not?

So for example, I mean in a defi protocol it makes sense, you know, the fundy tokens emissions go weekly to the projects that receive the most VE fundi votes, right? But here.

**Thuy:** Yes, yes, the emission, not commission emission.

**Simon:** Yes, that's the, that's the question now like how should we do this or not? What should we do? And with the incentives model I somehow like, but how should it. What would make sense?

**Thuy:** Emission can only send to.

**Simon:** Maybe we don't give any emissions.

Okay, so we don't do any emissions. Then what is the bribe in the incentive model? So for example, and the, and for voters. So for example, we have a weekly campaign, right? Weekly epoch.

So it's.
