## Key Discussion Points

### 1. Backer Requirements

**Need "Vector" (Not VC):**
- **Vector = Backer/Supporter** (different from VC investor)
- Someone behind you who supports and endorses you
- Not investing, but backing/begging/endorsing
- Critical for Western markets to avoid "scammer" perception

**Benefits for Backers:**
- Can be launchpad partner (e.g., Base foundation)
- They receive:
  - Projects building on their chain (Base)
  - More builders in ecosystem
  - Increased TVL
  - Enhanced reputation from top launchpad
  - More users to their platform

### 2. Funding & KOL Budget

**Marketing Costs:**
- Should reserve **10-20K for paid marketing**
- Need KOL budget for after fundraise

**Revenue Timeline:**
- With no-refund model: Receive money **before listing**
- Enables operational funding earlier

### 3. Realistic TGE Timeline (December Target)

**Prerequisites Before December TGE:**
1. ✅ Product/pitch deck ready
2. ✅ Team structure (CMO, CBDO, etc.)
3. ✅ Support from foundation (e.g., Base)
4. ✅ Choose appropriate chain
5. ✅ Social community built
6. ✅ Own Telegram/Discord channels
7. ✅ Contact launchpads
8. ✅ Complete all preparation

**Then:** You can decide timeline

### 4. Bootstrap Funding Strategy

**Cannot Raise from VCs (Fair Launch Model):**
- Need to **bootstrap** with own funding
- Must have own capital

**Funding Sources:**
1. **Foundation grants** (critical)
   - Get grants from Layer 1 foundations
   - Essential for initial capital
2. Self-funding for setup

**Social Media Decision:**
- Should **NOT use Favos social media**
- Too different from FunDeFi
- Need separate brand identity

## Critical Insights

### The Vector Strategy
- Having a **non-investor backer** (like Base foundation) is essential
- They benefit from your success (builders, TVL, users, reputation)
- Makes you credible to Western markets
- Acts as "insurance" for community trust

### No-Refund Advantage
- Get funds **before TGE/listing**
- Enables earlier operational spending
- Different from traditional VC model

### Timeline Reality Check
If targeting December TGE:
- Need ALL prerequisites complete first
- Product ready
- Team assembled
- Foundation backing secured
- Community built
- Can't shortcut the process
