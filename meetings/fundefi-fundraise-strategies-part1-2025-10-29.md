## Key Discussion Points

### 1. Launchpad Costs & Budget

**Marketing Requirements:**
- **10K minimum** to pay on CoinGecko/CoinMarketCap to rank
- Need to run marketing to make everyone know about launchpad

**Total Funding Target:**
- **500-700K total raise** (recommend 700K for better liquidity)
- Raise through multiple launchpads + Kanga Exchange (50K)

**Budget Breakdown:**
- **300K** to run the business (operational costs)
- **200K** to maintain the business (reserve for buying unsold allocations)
  - Critical for reputation: Must buy remaining allocation if project doesn't hit target
  - Prevents reputation damage that would block future partnerships

### 2. Liquidity Management

**Liquidity Pool:**
- **25-30%** of raised funds goes to liquidity (e.g., 100-150K from 500-700K raise)
- For fair launch TGE: 25% of raise amount to liquidity
- Better to have 100K+ for liquidity to ensure stability

**Market Maker:**
- **1 market maker** (not multiple)
- **3K per month** cost
- Needed for 1-2 months after listing
- Maintains price stability and creates ATH/lower cycles
- Essential for reputation even on DEX (Velodrome/Aerodrome)

### 3. Team & Operational Costs

**Team Needs:**
- UI/UX designer
- 1 tech person (maintain website, fix bugs)
- 1 operations person
- 1 CM (community manager) - support community
- Salaries for Simon & Thuy (BD roles)
- **200K reserve** for buying unsold allocations

**Infrastructure:**
- Google Cloud credits for servers
- Domain & website maintenance

### 4. Tokenomics Model

**Use Selena Finance Model:**
- **100% TGE** but structured distribution:
  - **25% in actual tokens** at TGE
  - **75% in VE NFTs** (veFundy)
- 3 NFT lockups: 3 months, 6 months, 9 months (25% each)
- NFTs can be used for voting (governance)
- Optional: Staking bonus if users stake the 25% tokens instead of claiming

**Benefits:**
- Reduces sell pressure
- Creates long-term alignment
- Enables governance participation

### 5. Launch Requirements

**Foundation Support (Critical):**
- Must work with Layer 1 foundation (Base recommended)
- Don't need investment/incentive from them
- **Key requirement:** They follow you and post about you
- Makes launchpad DD process much easier

**Team Structure:**
- Werner from CMC as CMO/CBDO
- Base team member (girl) as CMO/CBDO/SO
- Need CTO and CEO defined

**Timeline:**
- 2 months before TGE minimum for launchpad partnerships (e.g., Kanga)
- Need social community first OR strong backer

### 6. Marketing Strategy

**Different Approach (Not Traditional KOLs):**
- Airdrop campaigns with referral links
- Press releases
- AMAs with projects
- Announcement on website
- Airdrop campaign posts in airdrop groups
- 2.5% allocation of whole token for campaigns

**Still Need:**
- Marketing fees from projects (3% fee)
- Base cost for running project marketing
- Not KOL/traditional marketing focused

### 7. Revenue Model

**Launch Pad Fees:**
- Take 3% fee from projects
- Use revenue to run operations once profitable
- Initially need raise funds for operations

**Kanga Exchange:**
- Can raise 50K through Kanga
- Could target 550K total with Kanga included

## Key Insights

1. **Fair launch model requires significant capital** - Can't take money out initially, need to reinvest
2. **Reputation is critical** - Must buy unsold allocations to maintain credibility
3. **Foundation backing essential** - Need Base or other L1 to endorse for launchpad acceptance
4. **Revenue becomes operational funding** - Once profitable, use fees to run business
5. **Unique token model** - VE NFT approach reduces sell pressure and aligns incentives
